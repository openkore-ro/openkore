<h1>What is it?</h1>

A plugin is a file with executable code. It is not part of OpenKore, and can be loaded at runtime.
Plugins can add new features to OpenKore or modify existing behavior (using hooks). Plugins must be written
in <a href="intro/">Perl</a>.

<p>
Plugins depend a lot on OpenKore's internals. So to be able to write plugins, you must be
familiar with OpenKore's internals.

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> Do not confuse plugins with modules! See <a href="Modules.html">Modules.pm</a> for more information.

<a name="hello"></a>
<h2>Your first plugin: Hello World</h2>

Here's an example Hello World plugin. Save it as <tt>helloworld.pl</tt> in your plugins folder.

<pre class="example">package HelloWorld;

use strict;

print "Hello World!\n";

1;</pre>

When you start OpenKore, you will see this in the console:
<pre>Loading plugin helloworld.pl...
Hello World!</pre>

<h3>Analysis</h3>

As you can see, the Perl code in your plugin is directly executed.

<p>
A plugin should always start with the <i>package</i> keyword, followed by a package name.
This is not required, but is a good idea, because this way you can prevent function name clashes with the rest of OpenKore.
If you're not familiar with the package keyword, read the Perl documentation.

<p>
It must also end with <i>"1;"</i> or <i>"return 1;"</i>. Otherwise, an error message will be displayed.


<a name="hooks"></a>
<h2>Moving on: using hooks</h2>

The above plugin is not really useful. Here's a slightly more complex plugin.
This plugin will print "Hello!" every time OpenKore's <tt>AI()</tt> function has been called.

<pre class="example">package ExamplePlugin;

use strict;
use Plugins;
use Log qw(message);

Plugins::register("example", "Example Plugin", \&on_unload, \&on_reload);
my $aiHook = Plugins::addHook("AI_pre", \&on_AI);

sub on_unload {
	<span class="comment"># This plugin is about to be unloaded; remove hooks</span>
	Plugins::delHook("AI_pre", $aiHook);
}

sub on_reload {
	&on_unload;
}

sub on_AI {
	message "Hello!\n";
}

1;</pre>

<h3>Registration</h3>
Plugins must register themselves with <tt><a href="Plugins.html#Plugins::register">Plugins::register()</a></tt>.
This will add the plugin's name to the plugin list. The user can use that name to unload this plugin.
"example" is a short plugin name. "Example Plugin" is a short and slightly more detailed human-readable
description of the current plugin.

<h3>Hooks</h3>
The above example adds a hook for "AI_pre". Whenever the function <tt>AI()</tt> is called,
this plugin's <tt>on_AI()</tt> function is called too. Within this function, you can do whatever
you want. This is how you extend OpenKore's functionality.

<h3>Unloading</h3>
<tt><a href="Plugins.html#Plugins::register">Plugins::register()</a></tt> allows you to specify an unload callback.
Whenever the user tells OpenKore to unload or reload the plugin, or when OpenKore is about to exit, this
unload callback will be called. The point of this callback is to remove any hooks you added, and to shutdown
whatever you need to shutdown (such as closing sockets, deleting temporary files, or whatever).

<p>You don't have to provide an unload callback if your plugin doesn't add any hooks, and doesn't need to
shutdown or cleanup anything.

<h3>Reloading</h3>
The reload callback is very similar to the unload callback. When the user tells OpenKore to reload the plugin,
the reload callback callback is called: the unload callback is not called.

<p>
The point of the reload callback is that you can choose to only shutdown a few things, but not everything, because
you know you will need some things again (because the plugin is about to be reloaded).
For example, your plugin opens a socket connection with a certain server. You can close the socket in the
unload callback, but not in the reload callback, so you can immediately reuse the socket when the plugin is reloaded.

<p>Usually you don't need to special-case reloading. If you do not pass a reload callback to
<tt><a href="Plugins.html#Plugins::register">Plugins::register()</a></tt>, then the unload callback will be
automatically called when your plugin is being reloaded.


<a name="where"></a>
<h2>Where to put plugins to?</h2>

Plugins are stored in the <tt>'plugins'</tt> folder (if it doesn't exist, create it).
Files with the .pl extension in the plugins folder are automatically loaded by OpenKore.

<p>
OpenKore also loads .pl files inside the first subfolder of the plugins folder.
So if your plugin depends on external data files, you can put them in the same subfolder inside
the plugins folder.

<p>
<b>Example directory structure:</b><br>
<tt>openkore.pl</tt><br>
<tt>plugins/helloworld.pl</tt> (this file will be loaded)<br>
<tt>plugins/MyPluginPack/blabla.pl</tt> (this file will be loaded too)<br>
<tt>plugins/MyPluginPack/supericons.txt</tt><br>
<tt>plugins/MyPluginPack/subfolder/abc.pl</tt> (this will <i>NOT</i> be loaded)

<p>
Keep in mind that the plugins folder doesn't have to be <tt>'plugins'</tt>.
The user can choose to use a different folder as plugins folder, by passing
the <tt>--plugins=(folder name)</tt> argument to OpenKore.


<a name="data"></a>
<h2>How to locate data files for your plugin</h2>

Let's say your plugin depends on a data file called <tt>supericons.txt</tt>.
You can ask the user to copy supericons.txt to the <tt>controls</tt> folder manually,
but a much better way would be to put supericons.txt in the same folder as your plugin.
This way, the user only has to extract all files to the plugins folder, and the plugin
will Just Work(tm), without any additional configuration.

<p>
But how do you locate where supericons.txt is? You can't just hardcode "plugins/MyPluginPack/supericons.txt",
because the user might have specified a different folder as plugins folder, or renamed "MyPluginPack" to something
else. How do you locate where your .pl file is?

<p>
The answer is in the variable <tt><a href="Plugins.html#$Plugins::current_plugin">$Plugins::current_plugin_folder</a></tt>.
Whenever your plugin is being loaded, that variable's value is set to the name of the plugin's folder.
You must immediately save the value in your own variable! Because when the next plugin is being loaded,
the variable is set to a different value.

<p>
Example:
<pre class="example">package BlaBla;

use strict;
use Plugins;
use Log qw(message);

Plugins::register("blabla", "Example plugin which demonstrates how to locate data files", \&on_unload);
my $aiHook = Plugins::addHook("AI_pre", \&on_AI);
my $datadir = $Plugins::current_plugin_folder;

sub on_unload {
	Plugins::delHook("AI_pre", $aiHook);
}

sub on_AI {
	message "supericons.txt is located in this folder: $datadir\n";
}

1;</pre>
