<h1>How the AI subsystem is designed</h1>

The AI subsystem isn't really complex, but it could take a while to understand it's design.

<p>
All "intelligence" is handled inside the <code>AI()</code> function (right now it's one big function but
we hope to split it in the future).
As explained in the <a>Main loop &amp; initialization</a> page, the <code>AI()</code> function only runs less than a fraction of a second.

<p>
Basically, the AI tells Kore to do certain things based on the current situation. I'll try to explain it with some examples.


<a name="ex1"></a>
<h2>Example 1: Random walk</h2>

You're probably familiar with Kore's random walk feature.
If there are no monsters and Kore isn't doing anything, it will walk to a random spot on the map, and attack any monsters it encounters.
The following piece of code (within the <code>AI()</code> function makes Kore walk to a random spot if it isn't doing anything:
<pre class="example">
1   <span class="comment">##### RANDOM WALK #####</span>
2   if ($config{'route_randomWalk'} && $ai_seq[0] eq "" && @{$field{'field'}} > 1 && !$cities_lut{$field{'name'}.'.rsw'}) {
3   	<span class="comment"># Find a random block on the map that we can walk on</span>
4   	do { 
5   		$ai_v{'temp'}{'randX'} = int(rand() * ($field{'width'} - 1));
6   		$ai_v{'temp'}{'randY'} = int(rand() * ($field{'height'} - 1));
7   	} while ($field{'field'}[$ai_v{'temp'}{'randY'}*$field{'width'} + $ai_v{'temp'}{'randX'}]);
8
9   	<span class="comment"># Move to that block</span>
10  	message "Calculating random route to: $maps_lut{$field{'name'}.'.rsw'}($field{'name'}): $ai_v{'temp'}{'randX'}, $ai_v{'temp'}{'randY'}\n", "route";
11  	ai_route(\%{$ai_v{'temp'}{'returnHash'}},
12  		$ai_v{'temp'}{'randX'},
13  		$ai_v{'temp'}{'randY'},
14  		$field{'name'},
15  		0,
16  		$config{'route_randomWalk_maxRouteTime'},
17  		2,
18  		undef,
19  		undef,
20  		1);
21  }
</pre>

We call this block of code an <em class="term">AI code block</em>.
In other words, an AI code block is <em>an entire block of code which deals with a certain part of the AI</em>.


<h3>Situation check</h3>
In line 1, it checks:
<ol>
<li>whether the configuration option <code>route_randomWalk</code> is on</li>
<li>whether there are currently no other active <em class="term">AI sequences</em> (see below)</li>
<li>whether we're currently NOT in a city </li>
</ol>
If all of the above is true, then Kore will run the code inside the brackets.

<p>
What is an <em class="term">AI sequence</em>? It is a value within the <code>@ai_seq</code> array.
AI code blocks prepend values into this array so they can know when it's their turn to do something.
When an AI code block is done with it's task, it will remove that value from the array.
So, if <code>@ai_seq</code> is empty, then that means all AI code blocks have finished and Kore isn't doing anything else.
And this is when the random walk AI code block jumps in.

<p>
(There is also the <code>@ai_seq_args</code> array, used to store temporary variables used by the current AI code block.
If a value is prepended into <code>@ai_seq</code>, then a value must also be prepended into <code>@ai_seq_args</code>.
More on this later.)


<h3>Finding a random position to walk to</h3>

Line 4-7 tries to find a random position in the map that you can walk on.
(<code>$field{field}</code> is a reference to an array which contains information about which blocks you can and can't walk on.
But that's not important in this example. You just have to understand what this block does.)

<p>
The result coordinate is put into these two variables:
<ul>
<li><code>$ai_v{temp}{randX}</code></li>
<li><code>$ai_v{temp}{randY}</code></li>
</ul>


<h3>Moving</h3>

Line 11-20 is the code which tells Kore to move to the random position.
The function <code>ai_route()</code> prepends a <code>"route"</code> AI sequence in <code>@ai_seq</code> and
immediately returns.
Shortly after this, the entire <code>AI()</code> function returns.
The point is, <code>ai_route()</code> is <em>not synchronous</em>.

<p>
In less than a fraction of a second, the <code>AI()</code> function is called again.
Because the <code>@ai_seq</code> variable is not empty anymore, the random walk AI code block is never activated
(the expression <code>'$ai_seq[0] eq ""'</code> is false).

<p>
The AI code block that handles routing is elsewhere in the <code>AI()</code> function.
It sees that the first value in <code>@ai_seq</code> is <code>"route"</code>, and thinks <em>"hey, now it's my turn to do something!"</em>.
(The route AI code block is very complex so I'm not going to explain what it does, but you get the idea.)
When the route AI code block has finished, it will remove the first item from <code>@ai_seq</code>.
If <code>@ai_seq</code> is empty, then the random route AI code block is activated again.


<h2>Example 2: Attacking monsters while walking to a random spot</h2>

You might want to wonder how Kore is able to determine whether to attack monsters when it's walking.
