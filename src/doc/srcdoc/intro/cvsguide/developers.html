<H2>1. Download (checkout) source code from CVS</H2>

<IMG SRC="checkout.png" WIDTH="197" HEIGHT="75" ALT="Menu for CVS checkout" ALIGN="Right">
Go to the folder in which you want to put the source code.
Rightclick on an empty spot in the folder, and click on
<TT>"CVS Checkout..."</TT>.<BR>
A dialog will appear. Fill in this for the "CVSROOT" field:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>:ext:developername@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/openkore</TT><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
(Replace "developername" with your own SourceForge account name.)<BR>
For the "Module" field, enter a module name (see the previous page for
a list of modules).<BR>
When you're done, click on OK. The code will now appear in a subfolder with
the same name of the module. You can now modify the source code as you wish.


<H2>2. Modify the source code</H2>

This is up to you. ;) However, you should read the Developers Notes first
if you haven't done so. If you've downloaded the <TT>openkore</TT>
module, read DevelopersNotes.txt.<P>

<B>Tip:</B> you may have already noticed by now that all files inside
the module folder are green. Files that you have changed will automatically
turn red.


<H2>3. Tell CVS to merge your changes with the latest changes in CVS</H2>

<IMG SRC="update.png" WIDTH="197" HEIGHT="104" ALT="CVS Update menu" ALIGN="Right">
By the time you're done modifying the code, another developer may have
already uploaded his changes to CVS. This is why you should always
do a <I>CVS update</I>: merge your changes with possible new changes
in CVS.<P>

Rightclick on an empty spot in the module's folder and choose
<TT>"CVS Update"</TT>.<BR>
<B>Note:</B> sometimes CVS may report conflicts during merging. For
more information, read <A HREF="conflicts.html">"How to resolve merging
conflicts"</A>.
<P>

This command is also used to download the latest source code from CVS,
not just to merge your changes.
<P>


<H2>4. Upload (commit) your changes to CVS</H2>

<A HREF="commit.png"><IMG SRC="commit_small.png" WIDTH="118" HEIGHT="150" ALT="Commit dialog (click to enlarge)" TITLE="Commit dialog (click to enlarge)" ALIGN="Right" BORDER="0"></A>
Your changes will not be in the CVS repository until you commit them.<P>

Rightclick on an empty spot in your module folder and choose
<TT>"CVS Commit..."</TT>.
A dialog will pop up. In this dialog, you can:
<UL>
<LI>Select the files you want to commit.</LI>
<LI>Enter a comment about what you have changed in this commit. This
comment should be a short, brief, one-line description.</LI>
</UL>


<H2>Adding files to CVS</H2>

You can add all kinds of other files and folders to the module folder
(for example, adding the <TT>control</TT> and <TT>tables</TT> folders)
and do a commit. But those files <B>will not</B> be committed to CVS.
So you don't have to worry about accidentally committing your config.txt
(with your username and password in it) to CVS.<P>

If you want to add a specific file to CVS, you have to mark it for adding
first. Rightclick on it and choose <TT>"CVS Add..."</TT>.
<I>The file isn't in CVS yet!</I> You've only marked the file. The file will
really be committed to CVS when you do a <TT>CVS commit</TT>.<P>

<B>Note:</B> there are two kinds of CVS files: text and binary. If you're
uploading source code or text files (.txt, .pl, .cpp, etc;
everything that you can read in Notepad), you should mark the file as
<I>"Text/ASCII"</I> in the <I>"TortoiseCVS - Add"</I> dialog. If it's a
binary file (for example, images), change it to <I>"Binary"</I>.
