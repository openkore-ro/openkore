By the time you're done modifying the code, another developer may have already uploaded his changes to CVS.
This is why you should do a <em>CVS update</em>. It does the following things:
<ul>
<li>Downloads the latest source code from CVS. Only new or changed files are downloaded.</li>
<li>Automatically merges your changes with possible new changes by others.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Rightclick on an empty spot in the module's folder and choose <em>"CVS Update"</em>.<br>
<b>Note:</b> sometimes CVS may report conflicts during merging. For more information,
read <a href="conflicts.html">"How to resolve merging conflicts"</a>.
