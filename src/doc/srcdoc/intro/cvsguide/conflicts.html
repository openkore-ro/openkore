<H2>What are conflicts?</H2>

Imagine that you're working on openkore.pl. If someone else was
simultanously working on openkore.pl too, and also changed some of the lines
that you've changed too, an <I>overlap</I> occurs.
If you do a <TT>cvs update</TT>, CVS will warn you about conflicts
during merging.


<H2>Conflicts example</H2>

Suppose that you have downloaded
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/cvs/manual/html_chapter/cvs_3.html#IDX28">revision</A>
1.4 of <TT>openkore.pl</TT>. The part you're working on is:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
sub generateExampleFile {
	my $err = parse();
	if ($err == 0) {
		generate("control/example.txt");
	} else {
		print "No file generated.\n";
	}
	return ($nerr == 0 ? 0 : 1);
}
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

You've changed the code to:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
sub generateExampleFile {
	initScanner();
	my $err = parse();
	if ($err == 0) {
		generate("control/example.txt");
	} else {
		print "No file generated.\n";
	}
	return ($nerr == 0 ? $SUCCESS : $FAILURE);
}
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Someone else was also working on that function, and already committed his
changes to CVS (before you did) as revision 1.5. His code:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
sub generateExampleFile {
	my $err = parse();

	if (@_ &gt; 0) {
		print "generateExampleFile: No parameters expected.\n";
		return 0;
	}

	if ($err == 0) {
		generate("control/example.txt");
	} else {
		print "No file generated.\n";
	}
	return (!!$nerr);
}
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If you do a <TT>CVS update</TT> now, it will attempt to merge your changes
to revision 1.4 with revision 1.5. CVS will inform you about conflicts:
<PRE>rcsmerge warning: overlaps during merge
cvs update: conflicts found in openkore.pl</PRE>
Your original working file is saved unmodified in ".#openkore.pl.1.4".
The new version of openkore.pl now contains:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
sub generateExampleFile {
	my $err = parse();

	if (@_ &gt; 0) {
		print "generateExampleFile: No parameters expected.\n";
		return 0;
	}

	if ($err == 0) {
		generate("control/example.txt");
	} else {
		print "No file generated.\n";
	}
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; openkore.pl
	return ($nerr == 0 ? $SUCCESS : $FAILURE);
=======
	return (!!$nerr);
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.5
}
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Obviously, the code between "<<<<<<<" and ">>>>>>>" contains the overlap.
The code above the "=======" is your original code. The code under that
is the code from CVS.
<P>

To solve conflicts, you need to understand what you're trying to do,
what that other person's trying to do, and then think about how to solve this.
In this example, the solution is to replace the overlap with your
code:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
sub generateExampleFile {
	my $err = parse();

	if (@_ &gt; 0) {
		print "generateExampleFile: No parameters expected.\n";
		return 0;
	}

	if ($err == 0) {
		generate("control/example.txt");
	} else {
		print "No file generated.\n";
	}
	return ($nerr == 0 ? $SUCCESS : $FAILURE);
}
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

After you're done solving the conflict and saved the file, do another
<TT>CVS update</TT>. Then you can do a <TT>CVS commit</TT>.
