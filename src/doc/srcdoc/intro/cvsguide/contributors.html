<H2>Important note</H2>

The SourceForge anonymous CVS servers are known to be buggy. They tend to be down from time to time. If you're unable to access the CVS server right away, wait a while and try again.


<H2>1. Download (checkout) source code from CVS</H2>

<IMG SRC="checkout.png" WIDTH="197" HEIGHT="75" ALT="Menu for CVS checkout" ALIGN="Right">
Go to the folder in which you want to put the source code.
Rightclick on an empty spot in the folder, and click on
<TT>"CVS Checkout..."</TT>.<BR>
A dialog will appear. Fill in this for the "CVSROOT" field:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/openkore</TT><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
For the "Module" field, enter a module name (see the previous page for
a list of modules).<BR>
When you're done, click on OK. The code will now appear in a subfolder with
the same name of the module. You can now modify the source code as you wish.


<H2>2. Modify the source code</H2>

This is up to you. ;) However, you should read the Developers Notes first
if you haven't done so. If you've downloaded the <TT>openkore</TT>
module, read DevelopersNotes.txt.<P>

<B>Tip:</B> you may have already noticed by now that all files inside
the module folder are green. Files that you have changed will automatically
turn red.


<H2>3. Tell CVS to merge your changes with the latest changes in CVS</H2>

<IMG SRC="update.png" WIDTH="197" HEIGHT="104" ALT="CVS Update menu" ALIGN="Right">
Your changes will not be in the CVS repository until you commit them.<P>

By the time you're done modifying the code, another developer may have
already uploaded his changes to CVS. This is why you should always
do a <I>CVS update</I>: merge your changes with possible new changes
in CVS.<P>

Rightclick on an empty spot in the module's folder and choose
<TT>"CVS Update"</TT>.<BR>
<B>Note:</B> sometimes CVS may report conflicts during merging. For
more information, read <A HREF="conflicts.html">"How to resolve merging
conflicts"</A>.
<P>

This command is also used to download the latest source code from CVS,
not just to merge your changes.
<P>


<H2>4. Create a patch and submit it to the forums</H2>

A patch is a text file that contains the changes you've made.
Select all the files that you want to make a patch for.
Rightclick and choose <TT>"CVS Diff..."</TT> or <TT>"CVS-&gt;Make patch"</TT>.
TortoiseCVS will ask you where to save the patch file. Make sure you
save it with the <I>.patch</I> or <I>.diff</I> extension.<P>

After having saved the patch file, go to the forums, section
<A HREF="http://openkore.sourceforge.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=6">Addons, Mods & New Code</A>.
Make a new topic. There are two ways to post your source code:
<OL>
<LI>Copy & paste your code from Notepad to the web browser. Put the 
source code between [CODE] UBB tags (recommended way).</LI>
<LI>Add your patch file as attachment.</LI>
</OL>
