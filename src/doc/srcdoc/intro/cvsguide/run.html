<p>
So you have just downloaded the source code, and you want to run OpenKore.
To do that, download one of the following files:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://openkore.sourceforge.net/misc/start.zip">OpenKore Win32 launcher</a> (670 KB)</li>
<li><a href="http://openkore.sourceforge.net/misc/wxstart.zip">OpenKore Win32 launcher, with support for Wx interface</a> (2,29 MB)</li>
</ul>
Extract the file to the same folder as <tt>openkore.pl</tt>.

<p>
To run OpenKore, run <tt>start.exe</tt>. To run OpenKore with the Wx interface, run <tt>wxstart.exe</tt>.


<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h3>1. When not to use (wx)start.exe?</h3>

If you are a developer, and you want to work on OpenKore, then it's highly recommended that you
install Perl. OpenKore is able to reload its source code at runtime, so you don't have to restart it every
time you made a change. However, this feature is only available if a Perl interpreter is installed.
See the <a href="../index.html">Development Introduction Guide</a> for more information about how to install Perl.


<h3>2. How do I compile OpenKore?</h3>

<b><i>You don't!</i></b> In the past, there were two ways to run OpenKore from source:
<ol>
<li>Install Perl (and necessary third-party Perl modules), and run OpenKore using the Perl interpreter.</li>
<li>Install Perl, <b>and</b> the Perl "compiler" (PerlApp), and compile OpenKore into a .exe file.</li>
</ol>
Some people choose option 2 because they want to run OpenKore CVS on another computer, and they don't want or can't install Perl.
However, both of the above mentioned ways are now obsolete. The only thing you have to do now, is to keep updating the source code.
You don't have to compile anything. You don't have to install Perl.
You just doubleclick on <tt>(wx)start.exe</tt>, and that's it.


<h3>3. How does this work?</h3>

<tt>(wx)start.exe</tt> is actually a mini-Perl interpreter, which contains all third-party modules that
are required to run OpenKore. So this means that:
<ul>
<li>You don't have to recompile <tt>(wx)start.exe</tt> when the source code changes.</li>
<li>You must keep the source code around, otherwise things won't work.</li>
<li>Upgrading is simply a matter of upgrading the source code. This saves many hundreds of kilobytes.</li>
</ul>
