<H1>Introduction to CVS</H1>

One of the problems of multiple developers working on one
file/project is that they have to merge their changes with
each other.<P>

<A HREF="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS (Concurrent Versions System)</A>
is a tool that makes it easier
for multiple developers to work on one project.
Basically, it helps you with:
<UL>
<LI>Merge your changes to other people's changes.</LI>
<LI>Revert back changes that you've made.</LI>
</UL>

CVS is widely used in the open source world, and is a very
useful tool.<P>

<div style="background: #ffd0d0; padding: 6px;">
<h3 style="padding: 0; margin: 0; padding-bottom: 0.25cm;">Warning</h3>
CVS is a developer tool. The code in CVS is "bleeding-edge": some code may be experimental and not well tested. The code may not work, it may contain lots of bugs, it may format your hard drive. The code in CVS is not meant to be used by the general public, but is meant as a place for developers to store the latest versions of their source code.
</div>


<H2>Basic concept</H2>

The latest public release of OpenKore does not necessarily
contain the latest code (the code that developers are working
on at this moment). Instead, that code is stored on the
SourceForge CVS server (a <I>CVS repository</I>).<BR>
You shouldn't just take the latest public release and modify
that. Instead, you should get the code from CVS and work on
that instead.<P>

The OpenKore CVS repository contains several <I>modules</I>.
A module is a subfolder containing a part of OpenKore.
These are the available modules at this moment:
<table border="1">
<tr>
	<th>Module name</th>
	<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><tt>openkore</tt></td>
	<td>The main openkore source code, including the code for Tools.dll and Inject.dll. This is probably what you're looking for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><tt>confpack</tt></td>
	<td>The default configuration files (control/*).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><tt>tablepack</tt></td>
	<td>The default table files (tables/*).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><tt>fieldpack</tt></td>
	<td>*.fld files.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><tt>plugins</tt></td>
	<td>Simple example plugins for OpenKore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><tt>extract</tt></td>
	<td>Tools used to automatically generate recvpackets.txt</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><tt>grftool</tt></td>
	<td>Source code of GRF Tool, libgrf and related stuff.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<P>
Basically, this is what you have to do if you want to work
on OpenKore:
<OL>
<LI>Download (checkout) source code from CVS.</LI>
<LI>Modify the source code.</LI>
<LI>Merge your changes with the latest changes in CVS.</LI>
<LI>
	<UL>
	<LI>If you're a developer, upload (commit) your changes to CVS.</LI>
	<LI>If you're not a developer, make a patch and submit it
	    to the forums.</LI>
	</UL>
</LI>
</OL>

Each step will be explained.<P>
<B>Note:</B> this guide assumes that you are using MS Windows. If you're
a Linux developer, you probably already know how to use CVS.
<P>


<H2>Preparations</H2>

First, you will need to install a CVS client in order to access
CVS servers, just like you need a web browser to access HTTP
servers.
There are many CVS clients for Windows, but I recommend
TortoiseCVS because of it's simplicity and integration with
Windows Explorer:
<A HREF="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/">http://www.tortoisecvs.org/</A><P>
This guide assumes that you're using TortoiseCVS.
<P>

<B>Tip:</B> once you've installed TortoiseCVS, you should tell it to use
compression when uploading/downloading stuff. Rightclick on an empty
spot in any folder and choose <TT>"CVS-&gt;Preferences..."</TT>. Go
to the <I>"Advanced"</I> tab and choose <I>"3 - Low"</I> for
<I>Network compression</I>. <B>Do NOT choose a higher level of
compression!</B> Anything higher than 3 won't give much better results,
but will stress the server more. SourceForge already has to deal with
lots of traffic, so please don't set compression higher than 3.
<P>


<H2>Choose a guide</H2>

There are two guides: one for those who have direct write access to CVS
(official developers) and one for those who don't.
