<H1>What is CVS?</H1>

The latest public release of OpenKore does not necessarily contain the latest code (the code that
developers are working on <em>at this moment</em>). OpenKore has multiple developers, so each developer can't just keep his own code on his own hard drive: he'll get into problems when he wants to merge his changes with other developers' changes.

<p>
This is why OpenKore uses <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS (Concurrent Versions System)</a>.
The latest development source code is stored on the SourceForge <em>CVS server</em> (CVS repository).
CVS is a tool that makes it easier for multiple developers to work on one project.

<p>
You can compare CVS with an FTP server to which developers upload their changes to.
Now you may wonder why we don't just use an FTP server.
The reason is, you'll get into trouble when multiple developers work on the same file at the same time.
CVS can automatically:
<ul>
<li>Merge your changes with other people's changes.</li>
<li>Revert back changes that you've made.</li>
</ul>
In other words: CVS makes it easier for multiple developers to work on the same project.
CVS is widely used in the open source world, and is a very useful tool.

	<h3>Warning to users</h3>

	You might be a user who's interested the code in CVS, because it usually has more features.
	However, the code in CVS might be <em>in development</em>. This means that:
	<ul>
	<li>The code might be unstable or not well-tested.</li>
	<li>The code might not work at all.</li>
	<li>You might need to install additional Perl modules in order to be able to run the code.</li>
	</ul>
	In other words: the code in CVS usually also have more bugs.
	Although we try to keep the code as usable as possible, there's no guarantee that it will work correctly.
	Please keep this in mind.

	<p>
	When using the code in CVS, you should:
	<ul>
	<li>Keep a close eye on News.txt.</li>
	<li>Report any bugs you find, except if News.txt or the forum already says it's a known problem.</li>
	</ul>
</div>


<h2>Choose a guide</h2>

<ul>
<li>
	<h3><a href="users.php">CVS guide for users</a></h3>
	Choose this guide if you're a user who just wants to use the latest of the latest, and aren't interested in writing code.
</li>
<li>
	<h3>CVS guide for developers</h3>

	Only official OpenKore developers have <em>CVS write access</em> (ability to directly upload changes to CVS).
	Other people don't have write access. So I've written two guides.

	<p>
	Choose one of the following:
	<ul>
	<li><a href="contributors.php">For those who DON'T have CVS write access.</a></li>
	<li><a href="developers.php">For those who do have CVS write access.</a></li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
