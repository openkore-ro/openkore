<H1>What is CVS?</H1>

The latest public release of OpenKore does not necessarily contain the latest code (the code that
developers are working on <em>at this moment</em>). OpenKore has multiple developers, so each developer can't just keep his own code on his own hard drive: he'll get into problems when he wants to merge his changes with other developers' changes.

<p>
This is why OpenKore uses <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS (Concurrent Versions System)</a>.
The latest development source code is stored on the SourceForge <em>CVS server</em> (CVS repository).
CVS is a tool that makes it easier for multiple developers to work on one project.

<p>
You can compare CVS with an FTP server to which developers upload their changes to.
Now you may wonder why we don't just use an FTP server.
The reason is, you'll get into trouble when multiple developers work on the same file at the same time.
CVS can automatically:
<ul>
<li>Merge your changes with other people's changes.</li>
<li>Revert back changes that you've made.</li>
</ul>
In other words: CVS makes it easier for multiple developers to work on the same project.
CVS is widely used in the open source world, and is a very useful tool.

<p>
<div class="warning">
	<h3>Warning to users</h3>

	You might be a user who's interested the code in CVS, because it usually has more features.
	However, the code in CVS might be <em>in development</em>. This means that:
	<ul>
	<li>The code might be unstable or not well-tested.</li>
	<li>The code might not work at all.</li>
	<li>You might need to install additional Perl modules in order to be able to run the code.</li>
	</ul>
	In other words: the code in CVS usually also have more bugs.
	Although we try to keep the code as usable as possible, there's no guarantee that it will work correctly.
	Please keep this in mind.

	<p>
	When using the code in CVS, you should:
	<ul>
	<li>Keep a close eye on NEWS.TXT.</li>
	<li>Report any bugs you find, except if NEWS.TXT or the forum already says it's a known problem.</li>
	</ul>
</div>


<h2>Choose a guide</h2>

<ul>
<li>
	<h3><a href="users.php">CVS guide for users</a></h3>
	Choose this guide if you're a user who just wants to use the latest of the latest, and aren't interested in writing code.
</li>
<li>
	<h3>CVS guide for developers</h3>

	Only official OpenKore developers have <em>CVS write access</em> (ability to directly upload changes to CVS).
	Other people don't have write access. So I've written two guides.

	<p>
	Choose one of the following:
	<ul>
	<li><a href="contributors.php">For those who DON'T have CVS write access.</a></li>
	<li><a href="developers.php">For those who do have CVS write access.</a></li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Basic concept</h2>

If you'd like to work on OpenKore's code, you shouldn't just take the latest public release and modify
that. Instead, you should get the code from CVS and work on that instead.

<p>
The OpenKore CVS repository contains several <i>modules</i>.
A module is a subfolder on the CVS server. These modules are currently available:
<table border="1">
<tr>
	<th>Module name</th>
	<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><tt>openkore</tt></td>
	<td>The main openkore source code, including the code for Tools.dll and Inject.dll. This is probably what you're looking for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><tt>confpack</tt></td>
	<td>The default configuration files (control/*).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><tt>tablepack</tt></td>
	<td>The default table files (tables/*).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><tt>fieldpack</tt></td>
	<td>*.fld files.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><tt>plugins</tt></td>
	<td>Simple example plugins for OpenKore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><tt>extract</tt></td>
	<td>Tools used to automatically generate recvpackets.txt</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><tt>grftool</tt></td>
	<td>Source code of GRF Tool, libgrf and related stuff.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<P>
Basically, this is what you have to do:
<OL>
<LI>Download (checkout) source code from CVS.</LI>
<LI>Modify the source code.</LI>
<LI>Merge your changes with the latest changes in CVS.</LI>
<LI>
	<UL>
	<LI>If you're a developer, upload (commit) your changes to CVS.</LI>
	<LI>If you're not a developer, make a patch and submit it
	    to the forums.</LI>
	</UL>
</LI>
</OL>

Each step will be explained.<P>
<B>Note:</B> this guide assumes that you are using MS Windows. If you're
a Linux developer, you probably already know how to use CVS.
<P>


<H2>Preparations</H2>

First, you will need to install a CVS client in order to access
CVS servers, just like you need a web browser to access HTTP
servers.
There are many CVS clients for Windows, but I recommend
TortoiseCVS because of it's simplicity and integration with
Windows Explorer:
<A HREF="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/">http://www.tortoisecvs.org/</A><P>
This guide assumes that you're using TortoiseCVS.
<P>

<B>Tip:</B> once you've installed TortoiseCVS, you should tell it to use
compression when uploading/downloading stuff. Rightclick on an empty
spot in any folder and choose <TT>"CVS-&gt;Preferences..."</TT>. Go
to the <I>"Advanced"</I> tab and choose <I>"3 - Low"</I> for
<I>Network compression</I>. <B>Do NOT choose a higher level of
compression!</B> Anything higher than 3 won't give much better results,
but will stress the server more. SourceForge already has to deal with
lots of traffic, so please don't set compression higher than 3.
<P>


<H2>Choose a guide</H2>

There are two guides: one for those who have direct write access to CVS
(official developers) and one for those who don't.
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="developers.html">I have write access CVS (I am a developer).</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="contributors.html">I don't have write access to CVS.</A></LI>
</UL>


<H2>Further documentation</H2>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="conflicts.html">How to resolve merging conflicts</A></LI>
<LI>Full CVS manual: <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/cvs/manual/html_chapter/cvs_toc.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/cvs/manual/html_chapter/cvs_toc.html</A></LI>
