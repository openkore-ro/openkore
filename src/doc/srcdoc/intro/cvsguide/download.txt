	<h3>Note</h3>
	The SourceForge anonymous CVS servers are known to be buggy. They tend to be down from time to time.
	If you're unable to access the CVS server right away, wait a while and try again.

Go to the folder in which you want to put the source code.
Rightclick on an empty spot in the folder, and click on <em>"CVS Checkout..."</em>.
A dialog will appear. Fill in this for the <em>"CVSROOT"</em> field:

<blockquote>
<tt>:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/openkore</tt>
</blockquote>

For the <em>"Module"</em> field, enter a module name (see the the previous paragraph for a list of modules).
When you're done, click on <em>OK</em>. TortoiseCVS will now download the code; the result will appear in a subfolder
with the same name of the module.
