<H2>About Perl</H2>

Perl (<I>Practical Extraction and Reporting Language</I>) is an open source, cross-platform, interpreted, programming language.
It's main strength is string handling and parsing. Regular expressions makes it extremely easing to manipulate strings. You rarely have to worry about memory management since a lot of it is done automatically for you. It's syntax may be weird at first (compared to other languages, like C++, Pascal, Basic, etc.), but once you know it, you'll find out it's actually quite powerful. Perl, if used properly, is a <I>very</I> productive language.

<P>
Although Perl is an interpreted language, it <I>can</I> be compiled. Kore uses <A HREF="http://www.activestate.com/">ActiveState PerlApp</A> (part of ActiveState Perl Dev Kit) to produce a Win32 binary. Only <TT>openkore.pl</TT> is compiled - <TT>functions.pl</TT> is just a library used by <TT>openkore.pl</TT>, and is included automatically in the binary.<BR>
Compilation is only done by developers when they release a version to the public, since you can't expect all Windows users to install a Perl interpreter. There's no reason for developers to compile <TT>openkore.pl</TT> every time they make a change; it's much easier to run <TT>openkore.pl</TT> directly from the Perl interpreter.
<BR>Linux users can run <TT>openkore.pl</TT> directly. Most Linux distributions come with a Perl interpreter by default.

<P>
The official Perl manual can be found here: <A HREF="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/pod/perl.html">http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/pod/perl.html</A><BR>
Be sure to read <TT>perlintro</TT> first. That page also has a tutorial for beginners.

<P>
Other Perl documentation:

<LI><A HREF="http://perl.oreilly.com/">Books published by O'Reilly</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?q=perl%20tutorial">Google search for "perl tutorial"</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN - API documentation for many Perl modules and builtin functions</A></LI>
</UL>

<P>
If you have and don't know where to get a Perl interpreter/compiler, see <A HREF="setup.html">Setting up the development environment</A>.


<A NAME="cpp"></A>
<H2>About C++</H2>

If you're a developer then it's unlikely that you haven't heard of C++ already. There are <I>many</I> books about C++, try looking at your local library. And if you don't want to read a book for whatever reason, try <A HREF="http://www.cprogramming.com/">http://www.cprogramming.com/</A>.

<P>
Tools.dll and Inject.dll should be compilable by any standards-compliant C++ compiler.
But the recommended compilers are GCC (Cygwin) or MS Visual C++.
If you don't want to pay money for MS Visual C++, see <A HREF="setup.html">Setting up the development environment</A> about how to obtain GCC (which is free).
