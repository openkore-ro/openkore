<h2>Overview</h2>
OpenKore can be split into several components:

		Some things in Kore are written in C or C++, for the following reasons:
		<ul>
		<li>Performance. Parts that do a lot of calculation are optimized in C++.</li>
		<li>Some features are not  directly available in Perl. Some techniques used by X-Kore mode
			use very low-level Windows API calls, and can only be implemented in C or C++.</li>
		</ul>

		<a href="#xs">XS</a> is the native C-to-Perl glue. You can write stuff in C/C++ but provide a Perl
		API through XS.

		<p>
		The following things are implemented in XSTools:
		<ul>
		<li>Pathfinding calculation. It used to be written 100% in Perl, but that was (literally) 100 times slower.</li>
		<li>DLL injection functions, used by X-Kore mode.</li>
		<li>Platform-specific functions, such as a wrapper for
			<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/functions/shellexecute.asp">ShellExecute()</a>
			on Win32.</li>
		<li>Various other utility functions.</li>
		</ul>
		Because of performance reasons, the most performance-critical parts are written in C++.

<h2>About Perl</h2>

Perl (<i>Practical Extraction and Reporting Language</i>) is an open source, cross-platform, interpreted, programming language.
It's main strength is string handling and parsing. Regular expressions makes it extremely easing to manipulate strings. You
rarely have to worry about memory management since a lot of it is done automatically for you. It's syntax may be weird at first
(compared to other languages, like C++, Pascal, Basic, etc.), but once you know it, you'll find out it's actually quite powerful.
Perl, if used properly, is a <I>very</I> productive language.

<p>
Although Perl is an interpreted language, it <i>can</i> be compiled. Kore uses <a href="http://www.activestate.com/">ActiveState PerlApp</a>
(part of ActiveState Perl Dev Kit) to produce a Win32 binary. Only <tt>openkore.pl</tt> is compiled - <tt>functions.pl</tt>
is just a library used by <TT>openkore.pl</TT>, and is included automatically in the binary.<br>
Compilation is only done by developers when they release a version to the public, since you can't expect all Windows users to
install a Perl interpreter. There's no reason for developers to compile <TT>openkore.pl</TT> every time they make a change;
it's much easier to run <TT>openkore.pl</TT> directly from the Perl interpreter.
<br>Linux users can run <tt>openkore.pl</tt> directly. Most Linux distributions come with a Perl interpreter by default.


<h3>Documentation</h3>

<a href="http://perl.hamtech.net/learn/index.htm">Learning Perl</a> is a good online book
which introduces you to the Perl programming language.

<p>
Other Perl documentation:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://perl.hamtech.net/index.htm">The Perl CD Bookshelf</a> has links to other online Perl books.</li>
<LI><a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN - API documentation for many Perl modules and builtin functions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The IRC channel <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/perl"><tt>#perl</tt> at <tt>irc.freenode.net</tt></a>
is a good place to get help if you can't figure out something.
If you have a Kore-specific question you could ask at our <a href="http://openkore.sourceforge.net/forum/">forums</a>.

<p>
If you have and don't know where to get a Perl interpreter/compiler, see <a href="setup.html">Setting up the development environment</a>.

<h2>About C++</h2>

If you're a developer then it's unlikely that you haven't heard of C++ already. There are <I>many</I> books about C++, try looking at your local library. And if you don't want to read a book for whatever reason, try these websites:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/">http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cprogramming.com/">http://www.cprogramming.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
<tt>XSTools.dll</tt> and <tt>NetRedirect.dll</tt> should be compilable by any standards-compliant C++ compiler.
But the recommended compiler is GCC (part of Cygwin).

environment</a>.
