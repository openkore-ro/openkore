<h2>Overview</h2>
OpenKore is made of these components:

	<td>
		Tools.cpp implements a part of Kore's pathfinding algorithm (the system which handles how Kore walks from spot A to B).
		Because of performance reasons, the most performance-critical parts are written in C++.
		Pathfinding used to be written 100% in Perl, but that was (literally) 100 times slower.

		<p>
		<i>DLL injection (only on Windows NT/2000/XP):</i> Tools.dll contains functions used to inject Inject.dll into
		Ragexe.exe's process space.

	<td>Used by X-Kore mode. This DLL is injected into Ragexe.exe's process space, and intercepts all incoming and outgoing network data. This makes it possible for Kore to control the Ragnarok Online client.<p>

<H2>About Perl</H2>

Perl (<I>Practical Extraction and Reporting Language</I>) is an open source, cross-platform, interpreted, programming language.
It's main strength is string handling and parsing. Regular expressions makes it extremely easing to manipulate strings. You rarely have to worry about memory management since a lot of it is done automatically for you. It's syntax may be weird at first (compared to other languages, like C++, Pascal, Basic, etc.), but once you know it, you'll find out it's actually quite powerful. Perl, if used properly, is a <I>very</I> productive language.

<P>
Although Perl is an interpreted language, it <I>can</I> be compiled. Kore uses <A HREF="http://www.activestate.com/">ActiveState PerlApp</A> (part of ActiveState Perl Dev Kit) to produce a Win32 binary. Only <TT>openkore.pl</TT> is compiled - <TT>functions.pl</TT> is just a library used by <TT>openkore.pl</TT>, and is included automatically in the binary.<BR>
Compilation is only done by developers when they release a version to the public, since you can't expect all Windows users to install a Perl interpreter. There's no reason for developers to compile <TT>openkore.pl</TT> every time they make a change; it's much easier to run <TT>openkore.pl</TT> directly from the Perl interpreter.
<BR>Linux users can run <TT>openkore.pl</TT> directly. Most Linux distributions come with a Perl interpreter by default.


<h3>Documentation</h3>

<a href="http://iis1.cps.unizar.es/Oreilly/perl/learn/index.htm">Learning Perl</a> is a good online book
which introduces you to the Perl programming language.

<p>
Other Perl documentation:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://perl.hamtech.net/index.htm">The Perl CD Bookshelf</a> has links to other online Perl books.</li>
<LI><a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN - API documentation for many Perl modules and builtin functions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The IRC channel <tt>#perl</tt> at <tt>irc.freenode.net</tt> is a good place to get help if you can't figure out something.
If you have a Kore-specific question you could ask at our <a href="http://openkore.sourceforge.net/forum/">forums</a>.

<P>
If you have and don't know where to get a Perl interpreter/compiler, see <A HREF="setup.html">Setting up the development environment</A>.

<h2>About C++</h2>

If you're a developer then it's unlikely that you haven't heard of C++ already. There are <I>many</I> books about C++, try looking at your local library. And if you don't want to read a book for whatever reason, try these websites:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/">http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cprogramming.com/">http://www.cprogramming.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Tools.dll and Inject.dll should be compilable by any standards-compliant C++ compiler.
But the recommended compilers are GCC (Cygwin) or MS Visual C++.
If you don't want to pay money for MS Visual C++, see <a href="setup.html">Setting up the development environment</a> about how to obtain GCC (which is free).
