<H2>Setting up the development environment</H2>

This section teaches Windows developers how to setup the development environment.
If you're a Linux developer you should already have Perl and GCC.
All tools listed here are free. You don't necessarily have to use these 
tools if you prefer other alternative tools, but this guide will only 
teach you how to setup and use these tools.


<A NAME="perl"></A>
<H2>ActiveState ActivePerl - the Win32 Perl interpreter</H2>

You need a Perl interpreter if you want to work on Kore.
The best Perl interpreter for Win32 is probably ActivePerl:
<A HREF="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/">http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/</A>

<P>
(TODO: write instructions here about how to install Time::HiRes and 
Win32::API)

<P>
Perl is commandline-based. In order to run a Perl script you need to
type this in the commandline (assuming ActivePerl is installed to 
C:\Perl):
<PRE>C:\perl\bin\perl YourScript.pl</PRE>

So, to run <TT>openkore.pl</TT>, you need to type this:
<PRE>cd C:\Whever\Your\OpenKore\Folder\Is
C:\perl\bin\perl openkore.pl</PRE>


<A NAME="gcc"></A>
<H2>GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) - the C++ compiler</H2>

You only need a C++ compiler if you want to work on Tools.cpp and/or 
Inject.cpp. If you aren't interested in them, you can skip this step.

<P>
GCC is a suite which contains a C and C++ compiler. It's originally meant 
for Unix systems (and is the standard compiler for Linux), but Win32 
ports are available. One of the Win32 ports is called MinGW (Minimalist 
GNU for Win32): <A HREF="http://www.mingw.org/">http://www.mingw.org/</A>

<P>
TODO: write instructions here about how to install mingw.

<P>
The OpenKore source code contains the file "Makefile.win32", a makefile 
for Win32 GCC. You can use that to compile Tools.cpp and Inject.cpp.
The file "Makefile" is for Linux/Unix only.


<A NAME="editors"></A>
<H2>Editors</H2>

You can of course edit the source code in any text editor. It is, however, not recommended to use Notepad. Notepad doesn't support CRLF (Unix line endings; at least one of the developers develop OpenKore mainly in Linux) and doesn't support auto-indent.<BR>
For Windows, I recommend <A HREF="http://www.crimsoneditor.com/">Crimson Editor</A>, a freeware general-purpose code editor which supports syntax highlighting for many languages (including Perl and C++).
