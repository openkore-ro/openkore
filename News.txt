==================
### 1.5.0 (CVS)
==================

** NOTE **:
- Tools.dll is obsolete! You must get XSTools.dll and put it in your 
  'tools' folder. See the forum for more information:
  http://openkore.sourceforge.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=17344#17344
- The skill numbers listed in 'skills' have changed! They are now stable,
  so for example 'Heal' will always be skill #28 no matter what character
  you are playing, even if you equip accessories that grant skills.
  If you previously made aliases for manually triggering skills, you will
  have to edit them to use the new skill numbers.


New features:
- HUGE performance gains in portal compilation. It's now 70% faster
  compared to 1.4.x.
- You can now configure Kore to never attack certain monsters, even when
  they attack you. In mon_control.txt, set the flag to -1. Example:
  Matyr -1 0 0
- useSelfSkill, useSelfItem and partySkill now also support the
  _monsters config option, just like attackSkillSlot.
  This example uses Pneuma only when Raydric Archer attacks:
  useSelf_skill_6 Pneuma
  ...
  useSelf_skill_6_monsters Raydric Archer
  ...
- Priority attacks for non-aggressive monsters are now supported.
- You can set Kore to avoid/prefer walking through certain maps
  (see control/routeweights.txt for configuration).
- Support for advanced 2-2 skills.
- If you are granted use of a temporary skill (e.g. Yggdrasil Leaf,
  Abracadabra), you can use the sl/sm/sp/ss commands to cast it using the
  number shown in the "Permitted to use" message. Example:

  > ss 290
  Permitted to use Defender (257), level 5
  You use Abracadabra on yourself: Lv 10
  > ss 257
  You use Defender on yourself: Lv 5
- 'monster', 'monocell', 'death' and 'mvp' commands have been removed. If you
  actually use these, set these aliases in your config.txt:

  alias_monster ss 293
  alias_monocell sm 293
  alias_death sp 295
  alias_mvp sm 292
- If 'sp' command is called without a player target, it will target yourself.
  Useful for e.g. 'alias_heal sp 28'.
- 'Item Appeared' message and 'il' command now display the item's
  coordinates.
- The Linux version no longer depends on sys/ioctl.ph. This means 
  the dynamic interface (support for left/right arrow keys, etc.) will work
  out-of-the-box on many systems now.

New commands:
- guild join (flag)
  Accept or deny a guild join request.
- pl (number)
  Show detailed information about a player.

New config options:
- useSelfSkill_#_monsters
  partySkill_#_monsters
  partySkill_#_target_monsters
  useSelf_item_#_monsters
  Only activate useSelfSkill/partySkill/useSelf_item if a certain 
  monster attacks.
- partySkill_#_target_aggressives
  Only activate partySkill if a certain monster attacks a party member.

Bug fixes:
- Kore can walk on walkable water now (bug #21).
- Don't open shop immediately after login in X-Kore mode (bug #49).
- sitAuto_idle doesn't conflict with shopAuto_open's timeout now (bug #50).
- MO_BODYRELOCATION is now recognized as an area-usage skill.
- Don't display "level 65535" when an area-usage skill is used.
- Incoming Request to join Guild message now displays guild name.
- Alchemist potions aren't called [?254] anymore.
- Cards in equipment in storage weren't being displayed.
- $item->{type} is now set correctly for equipment in storage.

Internal:
- findIndex() and related functions are now much faster (bug #16).
- writeDataFile*() won't write trailing spaces.
- Functions in Tools.dll are now called through XS, Perl's native
  C-to-Perl interface.
- Kore now detects what directory its executable is in, and adds it to
  its include path (@INC).
- Fixed a crash when cart inventory is not available (such as during login).
- Some parseMsg messages moved to parseMsg_presence.
- Improved lockMap and randomWalk settings. Without route_randomWalk,
  lockMap_randX/Y modify the lockMap_x/y position by a random amount. If
  route_randomWalk is set, lockMap_x/y and lockMap_randX/Y specify the area
  in which randomWalk should walk.

Credits:
- Joseph: -1 flag support in mon_control.txt
- aputs: Support for the _monsters option in useSelf_skill, useSelf_item
  and partySkill.

==================

- Fixed the judgeSkillArea() error. I forgot to add this function in the
  last release, which caused Kore to crash.


==================
### 1.4.5
==================

New features:
- When a monster casts on you, you can switch target and/or avoid its spell.
  You can turn this option on by editing mon_control.txt. The new syntax
  for mon_control.txt is:
  (monster name) (attack) (teleport) (search) (avoid spell)

  Example:
  Minorous 1 0 0 1
  The "1" at the end will make Kore avoid spells casted by Minorous.
- Ability to automatically put items in cart. You can do this by editing
  items_control.txt. The new syntax is:
  (item name) (minimum in inventory) (autostore) (autosell) [put in cart]
  So to put all Flowers in cart:
  Flower 0 0 0 1
- Wx interface's map viewer can now attach to and detach from the main window.

New config options:
- attackMinPortalDistance (number)
  Only auto-attack monsters that are at least (number) blocks away from a
  portal. The default value for (number) is 4.

Bug fixes:
- Hopefully fixed some stuck problems.
- Hopefully fixed the teleport-search-vs-autosit bug (bug #67).
- Arrow equip is detected correctly.
- Lag will no longer (incorrectly) trigger autostorage/autobuy/equipauto.
- Fix partyAutoShare.

- Steven80s: new portals and maps.


==================
### 1.4.4
==================

New features:
- Ability to take an item as fast as possible (as soon as it appears):
  in pickupitems.txt, set the flag to 2. Example:
  Vitata Card 2
  This will pick up Vitata Card as soon as it appears.
- Auto-drop support: automatically drop an item when it appears in the
  inventory. This is useful for Rogues with auto-steal.
  In pickupitems.txt, set the flag to -1.

Bug fixes:
- The "monster with no name" bug should be a lot less common now, if it
  still exists at all.
- Fixed a bug which caused unjustified "Can't reach target" messages.
- Fixed party auto share.

Credits:
- Joseph: Auto-drop, fast item take
- mfr, Xeno-chan: advanced 2-2 skills support.
- Steven80s: Umbala maps and portals

==================

Bugfixes:

- *Really* fixed the bug which causes an infinite loop if the target
  monster is not reachable.

  autoBuy.


==================
### 1.4.1
==================

New features:
- idRO's new secure login keys are now supported. Set secureLogin_type to 4
  or 5, depending on your server.

New config options:
- secureLogin_requestCode
  If idRO's secure login key changes again, you don't have to modify the
  source code to be able to login. Put the secure login key in this option.
  Example:
  04 02 22 37 D7 FC 8E 9B 05 79 60 AE 02 33 6D 0D 82 C6
  (Do not append "DB 01" at the end of the key; it's automatically 
  appended.)

Bug fixes:
- The shop.txt parser now correctly handles CRLF (DOS) line endings in Linux.
- If you type "stand", then type "sit", Kore will sit and then stand.
  This is fixed.
- Don't attack monsters that are standing on a spot that's unwalkable
  according to the field file. This prevents an infinite loop.
- getAuto never gets triggered if you're low on a certain item. This has
  been fixed.


==================
### 1.4.0
==================

New features:
- "<name> refined weapon <success/failure>" messages from modkore added.

- Fix typo which cause lockMap_randX/Y to not work.
- The 'cart add' command now checks whether you have a cart.
- Fix some memory leaks.
- Various messages no longer spam X-Kore.
- partySkill targetTimeout is now honored.
- 'talk num' command bugs fixed.

New config options:

Credits:
- mfr: Updated emoticon list.


==================
### 1.3.5 (beta)
==================

- Fixed a rare bug which caused OpenKore to quit with a "version too old"
  error.


==================
### 1.3.4 (beta)
==================

Hopefully the last beta.

==================
### 1.3.1 (beta)

  See also http://openkore.sourceforge.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1633

- Support for idRO: secureLogin_type 3
- Added north/east/south/west/northeast/southeast/southwest/northwest

  alias_w west
  alias_s south
  alias_ne northeast
  alias_se southeast
  alias_sw southwest
  alias_nw northwest

  # new names for existing commands

### 1.3.0 (beta)
==================

** Important notices:
- The format of portals.txt and portalsLOS.txt have been changed. You must
  upgrade to the latest tablepack.

- Tools.cpp has changed. Linux users must recompile Tools.so.

- attackSkillSlot, useSelf_skill and useSelf_item and gotten a major
  revamp. It is recommended that you create recreate your configuration
  from scratch using the default config.txt.

  The biggest change is that _lower/_upper and that kind of things have
  been deprecated in favor of "range operators". For example, this:
    useSelf_skill_0_hp_lower 0
    useSelf_skill_0_hp_upper 50
  becomes:
    useSelf_skill_0_hp <= 50

  However, the old _lower/_upper syntax is still supported.


--------------------------


New features:
- Kore will no longer hug walls. Walking should be smoother now.
- Startup is now *much* faster than before.
  We've gotten rid of the "forking input server".
- Command prompt improvements:
  * Your command prompt will now be kept visible even when output is printed
    to the screen.
  * You can get the command you previously typed by pressing the Up/Down arrow
    key.
  * Keys like the Left arrow, Right arrow, Home and End now work.

- Support for priority attacks. Current only works with aggressive monsters.
  See control/priority.txt for more information about how to use this.
- You can now set your own NPC storage steps.
  See the configuration options storageAuto_npc_type and
  storageAuto_npc_steps
- Support command aliases. For example, you can write in config.txt:
      alias_heal sp 9
  and then if you type "heal 0", it will behave as if you typed
  "sp 9 0", so if spell #9 is Heal it will cast Heal on player #0.
- Even better support for opening warp portals.
  New command: warp list (list warp portal maps)
- Support for sending numbers to NPCs.
  For example, you can now buy Phracons in the Prontera upgrade shop.
  New command: talk num (#number)
- Background colors in consolecolors.txt are now supported.
- Added optional parameter for chist, "chist 10" will show last 10 lines of
  chat.txt.
- Better support for secure logins.
- Support for party skills.
- Added ability to activate skills or use items based on current active
  skills (such as blessed, agi upped, etc). This allows you to re-activate
  skills that have been deactivated without using timeouts.
  This is similar to modkore's _inStatus/_outStatus feature.
- Added ability to activate skills or use items based on current
  status ailments/looks (like poisoned, hidden, etc.)
- Added ability to equip items based on the current situation (hp, sp,
  what skills you're about to use, etc.)
  This allows you to, for example, equip a teleport clip just before you
  use teleport.
- The Linux version now automatically compiles Tools.so for you if it
  doesn't exist.
- The "follow" feature can now follow the master even if he's off
  screen, if the master is in the same party.
- The Linux version now longer needs --daemon.
  So './openkore.pl &' will Just Work(tm).
- You can now specify a location instead of NPC ID for storage/buy/sell.
  Format: map x y
  eg: storageAuto_npc prontera 29 207
  You must also add ai_npcTalk to timeout.txt
- monk's spirit is now supported, format: useSelf_skill_x_spirit < 5

New commands:
- warp list
  List warp portal maps.
- talk num (#number)
  Respond to an NPC with a number.
- plugin
  Control plugins. Type 'plugin help' for full usage description.
- ai clear
  Clears the AI sequence queue.


New configuration options:
- shop_random
  When set to 1, the item order in the shop will be randomized. The behavior
  in the previous releases was to always randomize shop item order, but now
  it's configurable.
- storageAuto_npc_type and storageAuto_npc_steps
  If storageAuto_npc_type is blank it will use the current steps (and
  display a warning)
  			     1 it will use the current steps (c r1 n)
  			     2 it will use the steps for the comodo npcs (c c r1 n)
  			     3 it will use the steps defined in autoStorage_npc_steps
  storageAuto_npc_steps is a (any number of) space(s) seperated list of
  commands to send while attempting to store.
  These commands consist of n which will send the cancel command
  			    c which will send the continue command
  			    r* which will send a responce where the responce number is *
  			    (NOTE responce numbering starts at 0 (unlike it does if you
  			    are using sendTalkResponse)) after training everyone to start
  			    counting at 0, i thaught it best to preserve it ;)
- secureLogin
  secureLogin_type
  secureLogin_account
  These options are used for secure logins.
- partySkill_#_*
  Used for party skills.
  See config.txt in the latest confpack.

  ailment/look, like poisoned, hidden, etc. Take a look at
  skillslooks.txt, skillsstate.txt, skillsstatus.txt and skillsailments.txt in the
  latest tablepack for a list of names.
- equipAuto_*
- useSelf_skill_#_notWhileSitting
  If set to 1, this skill will not be used while sitting.
- useSelf_skill_#_notInTown
  If set to 1, this skill will not be used if you're in town.
- route_maxWarpFee
  The maximum amount of money you're willing to spend on a Kapra which
  teleports you to another map.
- autoTalkCont
  If set to 1, kore will automatically type 'talk cont' for you when
  you're in a conversation with an NPC.
- attackAuto_inLockOnly
  When walking to lockmap, only attack monsters if this option is set to 0.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed comma placement in formatNumber sub (its what puts the commas
  in your zenny amount).
- When in X-Kore mode, the RO client will still work if you shutdown
  Kore. However, you can't start Kore in X-Kore mode again until you've
  restarted the RO client.
- Kore will now correctly continue if it gets resurrected before respawn.
- Even if it was resurrected using the Resurrection skill.
- avoid_ignore now works properly.
- Kore now works correctly on eathena servers.
- Damage numbers above 65535 (e.g. from Guillotine Fist) should be
  displayed correctly now, but my monk can't do that much damage; can
  someone test and report on the forum please?
- Fixed bug where openkore would say "Unknown uses" instead of the
  correct name of the player who had cast an area attack spell.
- Carded and forged items should now be displayed correctly everywhere
  (inventory, deal, cart, storage, vending shops). Post your comments in
  http://openkore.sourceforge.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1491
- openkore now supports the use of more area effect spells using ss/sp
  command.
- And lots of other misc bug fixes.


Internal:
- Fully migrated to the logging framework. Thanks to floAt.
- Experimental plugin system.
- Interfaces are closer to completion --interface can now be used on the
  command line to select an interface to use. 'Console' is the default 
  interface. There is only one alternate interface at this point 'Tk' a
  stripped down version of modKore's Vx mode.
- Support packet 01D7 (Karasu).
- New functions itemName() and itemNameSimple() to parse item info.
- teleportAuto_portal bugfix by joseph.

- anu: support for new deal packets.
- aputs: support for status ailments/looks.
- floAt: support for NPC positions instead of NPC IDs; party follow,

==================
### OpenKore 1.2.1
==================

- Removed error handler; it seems to be causing problems.
- Storage fix.
- Fix a crash with swrite() when using Perl 5.8 on some Linux systems.
- Fix a divison by zero error.
- Fix creation of "logs" folder on Win32.


==================
### OpenKore 1.2.0
==================

NOTE: This release depends on:
* tablepack version 1.2.
* The Perl module Win32::Console::ANSI (only if you're not using the .exe)

New features:
- Console text is now colorized. The colors are defined in
  control\consolecolors.txt
- You can now specify more than one item in useSelf_item_#.
- New regular expression for detecting GM names. This will get rid of many
  false matches. Names like "LaGMaster" don't match anymore.
- If dcOnDisconnect is set to -1, kore will not respawn nor disconnect on
  death.
- mon_control.txt's auto-teleport flag can now have two values:
  1 = teleport when monster's on screen
  2 = teleport when monster hits you
- Ability to automatically switch configuration file after a while.
  See the "New/changed config option" section about autoConfChange.
- Ability to tell kore to never sit, even when overweight.
- Both party and deal requests can now be auto-accepted.
  See the "New/changed config option" section about paryAuto/dealAuto.
- "drop" and "storage get" can now drop/get more than 1 item. Example:
  storage get 4,7   (gets storage item 4 and 7)
  drop 3,5          (drops inventory item 3 and 5)
- dumpData() now also dumps raw data so you can see strings (just like in
  hex editors).
- Ability to open a warp portal. See the "New commands" section about
  'sl' and 'warp'.
- A new experience report feature.
  See the "New commands" section about 'exp'.


Changes:
- Kore is now partially split into multiple modules.
- Some memory leaks have been fixed.
- Loading fields is now 3 times faster (it takes 0.3 seconds on my Athlon
  1.4 Ghz).
- Don't immediately reconnect if connecting to master server times out.
- The "sit" command now also sets itemsGatherAuto to 0.
- Don't drop target when a monster has already attacked you, but switches
  target later. This fixes a lot of "kore walks away when being kill
  stealed" complaints.
- Don't autorestart while taking items.
- Completely revamped cart inventory handling.
- Fixed storage issues.
- Log files (item log, chat log, walk.dat) are now stored in the logs folder.


New commands:
- cart desc - similar to 'i desc' but for the cart.
- Added the commandline argument --daemon. This argument allows you to
  start kore without input server so kore won't read input from console.
  Mostly useful for Linux users who run kore as a background service.
- sl - use skill on location
- warp - open warp portal
- exp - detailed report of gained experience, killed monsters, etc.


New/changed config options:
- useSelf_item_# can now be a comma-seperated list. Example:
  useSelf_item_0 Red Potion, Yellow Potion
- Config options for automatically switching configuration file:
  autoConfChange, autoConfChange_files, autoConfChange_min, autoConfChange_seed

  If autoConfChange is set to 1, switch configuration file after a certain
  amount of time. It's calculated as follows:
  time = autoConfChange_min + random(autoConfChange_seed)

  autoConfChange_files is a comma-seperated list of filenames. A random
  file from that list will be chosen as the new config file to load.

  Think of this feature as a more flexible version of timed lockMaps.
  With this feature you can not only set different lockMaps, but also
  different Kapras.
- sitAuto_over_50: when set to 1, kore won't sit when overweight.
- The config options "partyAutoDeny" and "dealAutoDeny" have been
  replaced by "partyAuto" and "dealAuto".
  0 = disable, 1 = auto-cancel. 2 = auto-accept


Special credit to:
- Digital Anomaly (support for packet 01EE)
- floAt (mon_control.txt's new auto-teleport flag)
- pmak (warp funcins)
- kokal (exp report)


==================
### OpenKore 1.0.3
==================

- *Really* fix vending this time.
- Fix storage listing.
- Fix avoid_ignore.


==================
### OpenKore 1.0.2
==================

- Fix vending.


==================
### OpenKore 1.0.1
==================

Bugfix release (iRO server changes on March 10 2004)
- Inventory listing fixed.
- Cart listing fixed.
- Linux version now uses XS instead of C::DynaLib.


==================
### OpenKore 1.0.0
==================

NOTE: a lot of new config options has been added. It's highly recommended
take the default configuration files and modify them, so that you won't
miss any of the new config options.

- Forgot to mention in the last News.txt:
  followEmotion requires another config option: followEmotion_distance
  The master must be within this distance to imitate his emoticons.
- Better way to autodetect platform (using $^O).
- Fixed teleportAuto_search.
- Added comments to some pieces of code.
- Fixed a typo in the clientSuspend AI sequence.
- Improved anti-looting.
- Don't get disconnected when AI's turned off in non-XKore mode.
- Changed avoidGM and avoid player code to an AI sequence.
  New entry for timeouts.txt:
	ai_avoidcheck 0.5
  New config options:
	avoidList	(set to 1 to turn on the avoid list)
	avoidList_reconnect
- Removed the need for the local_port config option.
  You can remove this option now!
- Input client child process will now exit correctly if parent process
  exits abnormally.
- Implemented a simple form of dynamic code reloading. All functions
  are now in functions.pl.
  New command: rc (reloads functions.pl)
- Vending code now supports multiple non-stackable items.
  Code by Star-Kung.
- Began work on Win98 support in Tools.dll and Inject.dll. It currently
  doesn't work so don't try it out!
- New config options:
  logChat, logPrivateChat, logPartyChat, logGuildChat, logSystemChat,
  logEmoticons
  Enables/disables logging of certain chats.
  The option logEmoticons is a comma-seperated list of emoticons numbers
  (see tables/emotions.txt), that you want to log.
- New config option: followBot
  Specifies that followTarget is a Kore bot. When enabled, a "move"
  command will be PM'ed to the follow target, telling him to go to
  where you are.
- Don't attack any monsters that are near portals.
- Renamed the following config options for better naming consistency:
  IgnoreAll      -> ignoreAll
  maxDmg         -> teleportAuto_maxDmg
  teleportDeadly -> teleportAuto_deadly
- Merged Karasu's storageAutoGet code and modified it a bit.
  Config options:
  getAuto_0 Red Potion
  getAuto_0_minAmount 10
  getAuto_0_maxAmount 50
  getAuto_0_passive 0

  Kore will go to storage (you need to set storageAuto and storageAuto_npc)
  to get Red Potions when you have 10 or less Red Potions in your inventory.
  It will get as many Red Potions as needed so that your inventory will have
  50 of them.
  If getAuto_0_passive is set to 1, then Kore will not go to storage when
  you have less than 10 Red Potions in your inventory. But, next time it
  goes to storage (because of overweight), it will get the Red Potions.
- New config option: useSelf_skill_0_inLockOnly
  Use a skill only when in lockMap.
- New config option: maxWeight_sellOrStore.
  Kore will sell or go to storage if weight equals or is bigger than
  itemsMaxWeight_sellOrStore. While walking to the sell/storage NPC,
  Kore will pick up loot as long as your weight is under itemsMaxWeight.
- New config options:
  storageAuto_distance
  buyAuto_0_distance
  sellAuto_distance
  Set a distance so Kore won't walk into an NPC.

xlr82xs:
- Removed dead monster count sub.
- Added admin password generation on blank aswell as default (since the skore default
  is blank, not "xxxxxxxxxx"
- New config.txt option securePassword. When turned on (ie set to 1) it will generate
  a new admin password every session
- New feature: random autoRestart:
  * Added new sub initRandomRestart() to randomise autoRestart in the config.txt file
    initRandomRestart() is controled by two new config.txt options autoRestartSeed 
    and autoRestartMin.
    autoRestart is now generated by autoRestartMin + rand(autoRestartSeed)
  * To carry on with the spirit of random restart times, there are another 3 new config.txt
    options.
    autoRestartSleep which turns on sleeping for a random time when set to 1
    autoSleepMin and autoSleepSeed (which act the same as the randomrestart options)
- Began work on better communication between bots. (Being lazy to start with (for a quick implement)
  and simply using a sub to detect known names (ie tank and follow targets, auth list users) that should
  be ignored by things such as chat ai so they can send eachother commands via chat (ie move, heal, etc)
  Eventually I'm looking at having the bots generate diagnostic information on a designated port, that can
  be polled by tankees (so they can find the tanker) and healers, so they can see the other bots location,
  hp, etc
  
- If you have the detoxify skill (by a card or being a thief) and get poisoned, you will automagically use it
- changed configModify() so it accepts a third paramater if it is 1 configModify() operates in "silent mode"
- added ai_itemExchangeCheck() returns 1 if you have atleast the amount of items specified in config.txt
	 you'll REALLY have to check the source for more information on this one (i just spent 10 minutes describing it
	 (i suck at documentation) and i'm about dead now)
  *  added AUTOEXCHANGE {  a new ai section to exchange items at an npc (see above for information about documentation)
	 although, the source is fairly documented...
  *  Made a note to make this more readable tommorrow after i've gotten some sleep.
  *  lots of new config.txt options along the lines of itemExchange_item_0, itemExchange_amount_0 itemExchange_minamount_0
	 and itemExchange_npc aswell as itemExchange_steps
- Shamelessly stole and implemented ebilguy / BCN's autodeal code




ChangeLog for skore-revamped
=============================

Another skore-revamped release (for those who complain about support for
(pre-)comodo):

- Added GPL clause.
- Improved platform autodetection. Won't attempt to execute 'uname -s'
  on Windows anymore.
- New function: lookpos().
- New command: lookp. Face a person.
- Resurrect the followSitAuto config option. Somehow it was in the manual
  but not implemented.
- New option: followFaceDirection. When set to 1, always look at master.
- Faster autofollow.
- "pl" and "ml" show more information now.
- Added support for recvpackets.txt (code taken from ModKore).
- Support secure login. New config option: secure
  0 = no secure login (iRO)
  1 = secure login method 1
  2 = secure login method 2
- New config option: guildAutoDeny
  Automatically deny guild join request.
- New command: guild. Support for listing guild members and info (thanks
  to ModKore).
- The avoidGM option is now split into avoidGM_near and avoidGM_talk.


Based on blueviper22's mod for RO 4.0:

- Merged X-Kore with skore-revamped. You can switch between "normal"
  (console) Kore and X-Kore by setting the config option "XKore"
  to 0 or 1. Add these to your config.txt:
  XKore 1
  exeName ragexe.exe
  commandPrefix ;

(Why didn't Kura do this in the first place? Maintaining one codebase is
easier than maintaining two.)


- More flexible packet debugger.
  * Removed option debug_packet
  * New options:
    debugPacket_unparsed: Dump unparsed packets
    debugPacket_received: Display all received packet switches
    debugPacket_ro_sent:  Display packet switches sent by the
                          RO client (only in X-Kore mode)
    debugPacket_sent:     Display packet switches sent by Kore
    debugPacket_exclude:  All packets switches that you want
                          to ignore, seperated by a comma.

- New config options:
  * followEmotion
  * followEmotion_distance
  When follow and followEmotion are on, imitate the master's
  emoticons if he's within followEmotion_distance blocks distance.

- Servers will now be hammered less if Kore gets disconnected.
  * New option in timeouts.txt: reconnect x
    (x is the number of seconds to wait before relogging in.)

- Improved anti-kill steal routines.
  * Bug fixes.
  * sendAttackStop() now actually works.
  * Doesn't walk away anymore when KS'ed.
  * The stun bug *should* be fixed by now but is untested.

- Code cleanups
  * Added comments to some parts of the code.
  * Indentication fixes (use Tabs, not spaces!).

- Renamed command "ai" to "aiv"
  Shows content of @ai_seq
- Command "ai" now toggles AI on and off.

- Respect itemHistory config option.

- New packets: 40A1, 01B0

- Automatically detect platform. No more need to change buildType if
  you're running Kore in Linux.

- Check valid $$r_args{'session'} before calling $CalcPath_destroy().
  This partially fixes a rare crash on teleport.

- "nl" now also shows NPC ID.

- Do not automatically attack monsters that are within than 4 blocks
  distance of another player. This makes you less suspicious.

- When a player teleports, he won't get removed from the player list.
  This has been fixed.

- Fixed attackAuto_followTarget. Attack the monster even if it misses
  the follow target.
