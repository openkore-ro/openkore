==================
### 1.6.2

  you can use their name in items_control.txt.
- The syntax for chat room commands has been changed. See below.
- Many "whenStatus(In)active" names have been changed, so that they're
  consistent with the actual item or skill names.
  For example, the status name for Concentration Potion has been renamed
  from "Concent" to "Concentration Potion", and the status name
  for Increase AGI has been renamed from "Inc Agi" to "Increase AGI".

  (if you want to know how many more Red Potion you can carry, and
  Red Potion weighs 7, then type 'weight 7').

  Use a specified chat command to open the storage instead of going
  to talk to the kafra.
- partySkill: notPartyOnly (flag)
  Use this skill on anybody, not just party members.
- partySkill: target_isGuild (list)
  Use this skill on the specified guilds.

New control files:

  cannot be reloaded). You can get a default version of this file
  from the default configuration files archive.

Internal:
- whenGroundStatus() now takes coordinates instead of a player/monster.
- There's now a %sys (in package Settings) variable for options in
  control/sys.txt

  700 KB of memory.
- New "b<item#>,<quantity>" NPC talk sequence, only useful to macro writers
  who use the 'talknpc' command. Buys <quantity> of <item#> (<item#> is the
  number shown in the 'store' list). Use after "b", e.g. "b b2,100".
- Cleanup of redundant functions.pl $map_string variable.
- Store lookID instead of itemID internally for other players' headgear.
  http://openkore.sourceforge.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=51034

  $ID eq $accountID ? $char : ($monsters{$ID} || $players{$ID})
- Network::Send::sendMove() redundant $r_socket first argument removed.
- New functions Commands::register() and Commands::unregister() for easy
  registration of new commands in plugins.
- Store $guild{member}[$c]{charID}.
- Get rid of useless %chars_old.
- The old $actor->name was renamed to $actor->nameString (but just
  reference it as $actorwhen constructing message strings since
  $actor is overloaded to call $actor->nameString).
- $player->{name} is now undef for players whose name is unknown.
  $player->name will return $player->{name} || e.g. "Unknown #300001".
- New $char->master function returns party or player information about
  your followTarget.
- Added hooks "packet_partyMsg" and "packet_guildMsg". argument hash
  contains 'Msg' (the message) and 'MsgUser' (the sender)
- Please use mon_control() from now on instead of accessing %mon_control
  directly so that "all" will work.
- $actor->{casting} now tracks what spell someone is casting on what target,
  and is cleared correctly when the spell completes/is interrupted.
- New hook packet_item_removed.
- All commands have been moved to Commands.pm.
- New plugin hook "player" passes a player object when "Player Appears"
  or "Player Exists".
- New items_control() function (use this instead of %items_control).
- functions.pl is able to run using strict (but isn't yet).

==================
### 1.6.1
==================

*** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES ***:
- teleportAuto_useSP is now obsolete my teleportAuto_useSkill.
- The _inInventory directive has changed. See below.

Bug fixes:
- Logging framework: writing messages to files should work again.
- Correct write to servers.txt for version search.
- Fix lockMap_randX/Y. lockMap_x/y acting as the top right corner of the
  rectangle. This is now treated as the center of the rectangle.
- Stopped the annoying "Attempted to use skill you do not have."
  messages by moving the message from error to debug.
- Fix autoBreakTime not working on some systems.
- Fix 'store desc <num>' command.
- Don't spam the teleport packet when you're not on one of the maps in
  allowedMaps. Only attempt to teleport up to 3 times, because some maps
  don't allow teleport.
- Fix a bug with empty partySkill blocks messing up partySkill.
- Static mode in the Console::Other interface now works correctly.
- Correctly strip language code from party chat.
- When someone in your avoid list sends you a PM, Kore will crash.
- Only clear AI if teleport succeeded.
- Fix a bug which causes monster IDs to end up in the player hash.
- Correctly move to a monster when using an attack skill if
  attackSkillSlot_#_dist is not set.
- Make "Unknown gained a [job] level" message and "[Guild]  : " message
  show up correctly in OpenRO.
- Fix "sp" command sending skill level 0 when unspecified (this wasn't
  a problem on Aegis, but was on eAthena).
- Fix monster avoiding teleport spamming.
- Hopefully fix problems with autoBreakTime on some systems.
- Storage will now work correctly with over 255 items.

New features:
- Beginnings of code that will allow skill usage on non-partied players.
  deltaHp condition added (currently useless to non-developers).
- Support for the 'charServer_ip', and 'charServer_port' options
  in servers.txt, which allow you to force connection to a specific
  map server.
- Support for eAthena servers. Set serverType to 3 for these servers.
- The _inInventory option's syntax has changed.
  Previous syntax:
    inInventory_name Red Potion,Blue Gem,AnotherItem
    inInventory_qty >5,>0,=10
  New syntax:
    inInventory Red Potion >5,Blue Gem,AnotherItem=10
- Support login error 1 as "Error: Server is closed".
- Use ai_cartAdd timeout if it's specified in timeouts.txt.
  This is for servers where you are disconnected when you try to add
  many items to the cart too quickly.
- A brand new console interface for Unix/Linux, which uses GNU readline.
  Input buffer corruption is now a thing of the past.
  You can activate it with --interface=Console::Unix
- Different RO servers can have different versions of the same field.
  For example, pRO is stuck with the old Payon while most other servers
  have the new Payon. OpenKore can now automatically select the correct
  field file by using servers.txt. You must have the latest fieldpack
  and the latest servers.txt from the latest tablepack.
- Support level 2 Teleport as well in blocks like useSelf_skill.
- Support for displaying broken weapons.
- A workaround for a server bug which causes autostorage to fail.
  See the config option 'relogAfterStorage'.
- Set attackDistanceAuto to 1 if you want attackDistance and
  attackMaxDistance to be automatically set by autodetection.
- New "dealAuto 3" setting works as a mix of 0 and 2.
  - It will auto-accept incoming deals.
  - It will finalize and trade if other party finalizes.
- Detect "Unknown error 10" = "You are out of available time paid for".
- "eq" command now accepts item names.
- Better support for _monsters and _notMonsters with attackComboSlot.

New config options:
- autoSpell (spell name)
  When the sage autospell list is sent from the server, Kore will
  automatically pick the specified skill name to be used.
  Combine this with a useSelf_skill for casting Auto Spell.
- tankersList is a comma-seperated lists of player names that should be
  treated as if they were in your party so they can tank monsters for you.
  It was previously called ksPlayers.
- dcOnPM (flag)
  Disconnect when somebody sends you a PM.
- relogAfterStorage (flag)
  Relogin after performing autostorage. This works around a server bug
  which causes autostorage to fail when you do it the second time.
- teleportAuto_useSkill (number)
  Specifies how you want to teleport.
  0 = Use Fly Wing to teleport. If Fly Wing is not available, use the
      Teleport skill if available.
  1 = Use the Teleport skill to teleport, and always show the "Teleport!!"
      message on top of your head when teleporting. If the Teleport skill
      is not available, Fly Wings will be used if available.
  2 = Use the Teleport skill to teleport, and only show the "Teleport!!"
      message on top of your head when teleporting, if there are other
      players on screen. If the Teleport skill is not available, Fly Wings
      will be used if available.
  3 = Use the teleport skill and never show the "Teleport!!" message. No
      SP will be used when teleporting. This option only works on official
      servers, not on eAthena or Freya servers.

New commands:
- doridori, bingbing, bangbang
  Same as the RO client's commands.

Internal:
- Wx interface: load some modules only when they're necessary. This
  saves about 2 MB memory.
- The first argument of getField() must now be a field name ("payon")
  instead of a filename ("fields/payon.fld").
- Add %monsters_lut to Globals.pm.

Credits:
- Squall: some minor fixes, charServer support in servers.txt.

- Correctly set names for VVVS weapons.
- Correct strip language code in public messages.
- Chat messages were saying "chatMsgUser" instead of the person's name.

- Fix display of map name in config.txt chat entries.
- Restore advanced 2-2 class support from version 1.5.0.

- The !include directive in a config file was causing everything above it to
  be clobbered.
- items_take AI sequence was getting stuck in queue if !itemsTakeAuto.
- 'guild leave' command actually works now.

New features:
- Don't use teleportAuto_minAggressives if the more specific
  teleportAuto_minAggressivesInLock is specified.

  0 = normal server
  1 = oRO (Oceania)

  in (list of maps). This is useful on pRO where GMs warp you to
  secret rooms.

  0 = respawn
  1 = exit

Credits:
- jsteng: VVVS weapon name bugfix, packet 01AB support.

==================
### 1.5.2 (beta)
==================

** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES **:
- For users of teleportAuto_search, in order to have it work you must now:
  * Set teleportAuto_idle to 1
  * Set ai_teleport_idle in timeouts.txt to the same as ai_teleport_search
  * Delete ai_teleport_search in timeouts.txt (it is obsolete)
  * Set route_randomWalk to 0
- If you have been using "maxUses" to limit the number of times you attempt to
  cast a skill, you may have to change it to "maxAttempts" instead.
- Kobolds have been renamed from Kobold # to Kobold-#.
  Many people don't know about using tabs in mon_control.txt, and
  would probably have problems figuring out what to do for Kobolds.
  Example: Kobold 1 is now Kobold-1


Bug fixes:
- Correctly detect pets.
- Fix all kinds of troubles regarding sitting and standing.
- Set maxDistance = distance (instead of defaulting to 30) in attackSkillSlot.
- The 'conf' chat command now works.
- partyAggressives now counts monsters your party attacked
- Fixed some cases of ksPlayers not working
- When following master around a corner, fallback to routing algorithm instead
  of trying to walk through the corner
- Don't increment maxUses counter for an attackSkillSlot until the skill is
  actually used (internal note: this counter is indexed using the monster ID
  and the skill ID, so if you have more than one attackSkillSlot or
  monsterSkill block that uses the same skill, they will unexpectedly share
  the same maxUses counter)
- Fix reference to undefined variable $skillID in ai_skillUse2()
- Make _stopWhenHit condition not count party members, and stop counting a
  monster as aggressive if it hit you in the past, but then attacked someone
  else

- "exp reset" command now resets damage statistics in 's' command
- Portal recording has been fixed.

- Fix bugged teleportAuto_onlyWhenSafe.

New features:
- Mask password input display '*' instead of your real password (Only on linux
  console)
- If old files (from before the CVS cleanup) are found, warn the user
  and bail out. Too many people are reporting "bugs" that are a result
  of conflicts with old files.
- More avoidGM modes. See the news avoid the new avoidGM_near config option.
- The autoresponse system is now back, and improved. The chat_resp.txt
  format has changed. Kore will also not respond to people who are repeating
  themselves.
- teleportAuto_search will now prevent attackAuto from attacking monsters in
  the event that no monsters you are searching for exist onscreen.
- chat.txt uses one line per message, allowing grepping.
- skillsAddAuto will now print a message when it auto-adds a skill.
- Display source and destination coordinates in "Recorded new portal" message.
- route_teleport is now a normal message instead of a debug message (something
  that made my party bot suddenly teleport away from me should not be silent).
- "Failed to take <item>" message now shows more information.
- If a monster's name in monsters.txt is different from what the server sends,
  the name in monsters.txt prevails. (Lets us distinguish between monsters
  that the server gives the same name to, but are different)
- WX Advance Settings now support proxy for download manual.
  You have to add lines 'webproxy' and 'webproxy_port' in config.txt to enable
  proxy.
- storageAuto will now check if you have the ability to open storage.
- Bulk selling has finally been implemented! Kore will always auto-sell this
  way from now on, no need to set any config options.
- Reset monster aggression when it changes to another type of monster.

New config options:
- ksPlayers is a comma-seperated lists of player names that should be treated
  as if they were in your party for the purpose of KS checks.
- beepDomains contains a list of message domains (see Log.pm) for which
  openkore will beep.
- beepDomains_notInTown contains a list of message domains that are exempted
  from beepDomains if you are in a town.
- beepOnChat and beepOnPM were removed. Use this instead:
  beepDomains publicchat,emotion,pm
- New selfCondition _whenPermitSkill _whenNotPermitSkill for use in auto-skill
  usage blocks; they are true/false respectively when you have been granted
  use of that temporary skill.
- New condition _smartEncore for useSelfSkill. When 1, it will cast the
  Encore skill instead of this skill if Encore would cause this skill to
  be cast (saves SP for bards and dancers).
- avoidGM_near now supports different modes:
  0 - disabled (do not avoid GM)
  1 - teleport & disconnect
  2 - disconnect
  3 - teleport
  4 - respawn
- New 'previousDamage (range)' condition for attackSkillSlot.
  Use this skill only when your damage to the monster is between the
  specified range.
- teleportAuto_maxDmgInLock (number)
  Similar to teleportAuto_maxDmg, but only has effect when in lockMap.
- teleportAuto_minAggressivesInLock (number)
  Similar to teleportAuto_minAggressives, but only has effect when in lockMap.
- portalRecord:
  0 - don't automatically record portals
  1 - record portals you walk through
  2 - record the return portal too (by guessing)
- webproxy <proxy_addr>
  webproxy_port <port>
  To enable and specify whether WX will use this proxy for downloading the manual.
- sellAuto_standpoint <map> <x> <y>
  buyAuto {
	standpoint <map> <x> <y>
  }
  Bots will use this location as a standpoint instead of anywhere near NPC
  itself.

Internal:
- Move a "pm" message into "pm/sent" domain so that "beepOnDomains pm" won't
  beep on your own PMs.
- Add a third argument $obj to objectRemoved() function (just like
  objectAdded() has), and moved the objectRemoved() calls to just before the
  object was deleted so that $obj still exists when it is called.

- The Wx map viewer's xpmmake() has been rewritten in C++ for speed.
  It is now more than 100 times faster.
- makeDistMap() has also been written in C++ and is now more than 100
  times faster.

==================
### 1.5.1 (beta)
==================

Bug fixes:
- Fix "undefined value as HASH" bug in the Wx item list control.

- Fix crash when using "move" and "date" commands via PM/chat.
- partySkill target_timeouts are now saved when openkore uses the skill
  on the person, not when it tries to use it.
- The day parameter for autoBreakTime is no longer case sensitive.
- Fix a routing problem which causes Kore to walk back and forth.
- Various attackComboSlot bug fixes.
- "You are in Stunned state" message was verbosity 2 instead of 1.

- "Inventory Item Removed" message was not being displayed when you drop
  (instead of fire) arrows.
- Your shop title and chatroom title will not longer than 36 characters.
- openkore was allowing more than 10 items to be added to the deal (bug #31)
  if you were adding more than one of the same type of equipment. The server

  lot of "deal add" commands faster than the server responds.
- 'autosell' command will now work even if sellAuto is set to 0.
- Don't trigger sellAuto after storageAuto if sellAuto is 0.
- Set $char->{spirits} to 0 upon changing map servers.
- Fix teleporting for characters that have Teleport level 0.
- $monsters{$targetID}{skillUses}{$skill->handle}++ line was auto-vivifying
  $monsters{$targetID}, making players getting incorrectly counted as monsters
  and causing various bugs such as ghost player images, and
  itemsTakeAuto_party not working.

  Khalitzburg even if it's not your current target, or knight can
  provoke all Sohees and then Brandish Spear them.
- statAddAuto_list is now case-insensitive.
- Recognize "Unknown error 15" ("You have been forced to disconnect by a GM").
- 'conf' command will now display what the old value was.

      target_defendMonsters Raydric Archer
  }
  will only cast this skill if a Raydric Archer's last attack hit the person.
- verboseDomains is the opposite of squelchDomains.
- missDamage; any damage you do <= this amount will be counted as a miss.
  (e.g. for monks who have Spirit Spheres)
- teleportAuto_useSP if set to 2 will only use SP when other players are 
  present.

  If set to 1 then statsAddAuto will not factor in the stat bonuses at all.
- teleportAuto_attackedWhenSitting (flag)
  Teleport when a monster attacked you while you're auto-sitting. This is useful if

New timeouts.txt options:
- ai_teleport 1
  Specifies the timeout for using Fly Wing when teleporting. This prevents Kore

  Display last few entries of the item log.
- move [Portal Number]
  To move into portal if portals exist.

Internal:
- $interface->beep() function for cross-platform beep support.
- OpenKore will exit if a plugin failed to load.
- OpenKore will exit if a configuration file failed to load.
- checkMonsterCondition() now takes a monster hash instead of monster ID.
  (Perhaps other similar functions should be converted too)

  (x,y) coordinates for area-targetted skills.
- Move some messages from "route" to "route_teleport" domain.
- Comment out stopAttack() to try to fix "bot attacks slowly when buff

==================
### 1.5.0 (beta)
==================

A new beta version, 1.5.0, has finally been released. A lot of stuff
has changed, and your old configuration files may not work, so please
read this document thoroughly. But the easiest way is to delete your
configuration files and start from scratch using the new default
configuration files.
Remember: this is a BETA version. It may not be stable.

Special thanks to the following people; OpenKore would not have been
possible without them:
- Joseph: -1 and 2 attack-auto support in mon_control.txt,
  avoidList_inLockOnly, auto cart get, misc other things
- aputs: Support for the _monsters option in useSelf_skill, useSelf_item
  and partySkill.
- obyarou: Priority attack support for non-aggressive monsters,
  shop timeout in X-Kore bugfix (bug #49), sitAuto_idle vs
  shopAuto_open conflict fix (bug #50), other misc bugfixes.
- fov: writeDataFile*() tweaks, lockMap and randomWalk tweaks,
  partySkills for certain jobs
- polokus: idRO Amatsu/Kunlun support
- Ven`Tatsu: walkable water bugfix (bug #21)
- sparshong: character creation/deletion packet code.
- jsteng, littlewens: mute packet support, chat room list clear bugfix.
- anoxemian: (partial?) kRO/PK server support.
- doenet: improved mon_control.txt, randomWalk and lockMap
  fixes/improvements.
- BotMan: server details for pRO.
- anu: add storage opening timeout, teleportAuto_dropTarget
- juifeng: NPC talk timeout fix when using "d#" talk code
- isieo: attackComboSlot bugfix
- brianhj: auto stat-add


** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES **:
- Tools.dll is obsolete! Delete it!
- The skill numbers listed in 'skills' have changed! They are now stable,
  so for example 'Heal' will always be skill #28 no matter what character
  you are playing, even if you equip accessories that grant skills.
  If you previously made aliases for manually triggering skills, you will
  have to edit them to use the new skill numbers.
- All server-specific information is now stored in servers.txt. The
  master_* config options are now obsolete.


New features:
- HUGE performance gains in portal compilation. It's now 70% faster
  compared to 1.4.x.
- You can now configure Kore to never attack certain monsters, even when
  they attack you. In mon_control.txt, set the flag to -1. Example:
  Matyr -1 0 0
- useSelfSkill, useSelfItem and partySkill now also support the
  _monsters config option, just like attackSkillSlot.
  This example uses Pneuma only when Raydric Archer attacks:
  useSelf_skill Pneuma {
      monsters Raydric Archer
  }
- Priority attacks for non-aggressive monsters are now supported.
- You can set Kore to avoid/prefer walking through certain maps
  (see control/routeweights.txt for configuration).
- Support for advanced 2-2 skills.
- If you are granted use of a temporary skill (e.g. Yggdrasil Leaf,
  Abracadabra), you can use the sl/sm/sp/ss commands to cast it using the
  number shown in the "Permitted to use" message. Example:

  > ss 290
  Permitted to use Defender (257), level 5
  You use Abracadabra on yourself: Lv 10
  > ss 257
  You use Defender on yourself: Lv 5
- 'monster', 'monocell', 'death' and 'mvp' commands have been removed. If you
  actually use these, set these aliases in your config.txt:

  alias_monster ss 293
  alias_monocell sm 293
  alias_death sp 295
  alias_mvp sm 292
- If 'sp' command is called without a player target, it will target yourself.
  Useful for e.g. 'alias_heal sp 28'.
- 'Item Appeared' message and 'il' command now display the item's
  coordinates.
- The Linux version no longer depends on sys/ioctl.ph. This means 
  the dynamic interface (support for left/right arrow keys, etc.) will work
  out-of-the-box on many systems now.
- Support for creation and deletion of characters.
- Weapon upgrades are now detected.
- Newbie zones are now correctly supported.
- Delay of attacks is now displayed. 200 - Delay indicates the ASPD.
- Support for partySkills on certain job classes.
- kRO/PK servers are now (partially?) supported. In config.txt, set
  pkServer to 1.
- TAB completion in Wx and Linux interface!!!
- Input history support in Linux interface.
- Spells being cast now show how long they take.
- Combo skill support.
- While walking, Kore can teleport until it's near the destination.
- New command "spells" will display what area effects are currently active,
  e.g. Pneuma, Warp Portal
- Area effect spell appeared/disappeared message added,
  domain skill, debug level 2
- When displaying exp gained, also display % of base/job gained
- New talk sequence code:
  d# - send # to the NPC (useful for buying forging items)
  If you wanted to buy 100 mini furnaces for example:
  c r1 c r0 c d100
- Auto-detect saveMap when you cast Teleport level 2. (If saveMap is
  set incorrectly, you'll have to type 'respawn' twice; once to get it
  to auto-detect the saveMap, and then it'll work the second time.)
- parseMsg_statuslook verbose 1 displays status effects on you;
  verbose 2 displays status effects on others.
- "vl" (vender list) command now displays coordinates.
- Automatic disconnection during specified times of the day.
- If storage opening fails the first time for some reason, Kore will try again.
- The bot will now look at NPCs when it is talking to them, like a real player.
- When you issue a "move" command, this will clear previous move actions.
- When the amount of zeny you have changes, you will be told.
- Support for specifying hair color and hair style at character creation.
- Improvements in the Wx interface: advanced configuration editor, info bar,
  ability to send PMs.
- Automatically raise stats.

mon_control.txt:
- mon_control.txt has gained more features. The new syntax is:
  (monster name) (attack) (teleport) (search) (skillcancel) (lv) (joblv) (hp) (sp)

- (attack-auto):
  You can now mark a monster as "always aggressive". This means that, 
  if a certain monster is on screen, Kore will always attack it, even
  when Kore is sitting and the monster isn't attacking you.
  In mon_control.txt, set the (attack_auto) flag to 2.
  Example:
  Skeleton Soldier 2 0 0 0
- (level):
  You can configure Kore to only attack a monster, if your base level is high
  enough. Example:
  Sohee 1 0 0 50
  Only attack Sohee if your are lv 50 or higher.

items_control.txt:
- items_control.txt now has ability to automatically get items from cart
  The new syntax is:
  (item name) (minimum in inventory) (autostore) (autosell) [put in cart] [get from cart]
  So to automatically keep 10 Meat in inventory from cart:
  Meat 10 0 0 0 1

New commands:
- guild join (flag)
  Accept or deny a guild join request.
- pl (number)
  Show detailed information about a player.
- switchconf (file)
  Switch to another configuration file.

New config options:
- attackMaxDistance (number)
  You should set it to 2.5
- useSelf_skill, partySkill and useSelf_item now also support the 'monsters'
  and 'notMonsters' options.
- New partySkill options:
  * target_aggressives
    Only activate partySkill if a certain monster attacks a party member.
  * target_isJob
  * target_isNotJob
    Only activate partySkill for certain job classes

- attackComboSlot {
     ...everything that attackSkillSlot supports is also supported here...
     afterSkill (skill name)
     waitBeforeUse (number of seconds)
  }
  Use a certain attack skill, after another attack skill was last used.

- avoidList_inLockOnly (flag)
  Set to 1, if you want to avoid people on your avoid list when they
  are on screen, but only when you are in lockMap.
- pkServer (flag)
  To to 1 if you're playing kRO or on a PK server.
- dcOnMute (flag)
  Disconnect when you have been muted by a GM.
- attackMinPlayerDistance (number)
  Only auto-attack monsters that are at least (number) blocks away from
  other players. (number) is at least 3; if you enter a lower value, Kore
  will treat it as 3.
- teleportAuto_atkMiss (number)
  Teleport if you've missed a monster more than (number) times in a row.
  This is useful if you're trying to attack a monster with the wrong
  elemental weapon, for example.

- route_teleport (flag)
  route_teleport_minDistance (number)
  route_teleport_maxTries (number)

  While walking to other maps, Kore will teleport until it's near a
  portal, if route_teleport is enabled. It will keep teleporting until
  it's at least route_teleport_minDistance steps away from the portal.
  It will attempt to teleport at most route_teleport_maxTries times,
  before falling back to walking.
  It's recommended that you set a value between 100 or 200 for
  route_teleport_minDistance.
- New conditions _whenGround and _whenNotGround can e.g. cast a skill
  only if certain conditions are met. For example:

  useSelf_skill Pneuma {
      lvl 1
      monsters Raydric Archer
      whenNotGround Pneuma
  }

  will use the Pneuma skill if you are fighting Raydric Archer, and
  there is not already a Pneuma affecting you.
- New condition _whenIdle for use only when the bot is doing nothing
- Automatic disconnection during certain times of the day. Example:

  autoBreakTime Sun {
    startTime 21:29
    stopTime 1:08
  }

  will disconnect at 9:29 P.M. on Sunday and resume botting at
  1:08 A.M. on Monday.
  You can only specify breaks of less than 24 hours.
  You can add multiple break times by adding additional blocks.
  Only specify the first three letters of the week day.
- The autoConfChanged syntax has changed, and is now more powerful.
  autoConfChange (filenames...) {
    minTime (number)
    varTime (number)
    lvl (range)
    joblvl (range)
  }

  (filenames...) is a list of filenames, seperated by comma. A
  random file out of this list will be selected.
  Kore will wait at least minTime seconds, and at most minTime + varTime
  seconds before switching config file.
  If lvl and joblvl are given, Kore will only switch config file if you're
  in the given level or job level range.
- teleportAuto_dropTarget (flag)
  Teleport if you can't reach a monster.
- partyAggressives condition works like aggressives, but also counts
  monsters that have fought party members.
- New attackSkillSlot option: _notMonsters
  attackSkillSlot Bash {
    lvl 1
    dist 1.5
    notMonsters Green Plant, Poring, Lunatic
  }
- itemsTakeAuto_party 1 will take items from monsters killed by party members.
- attackAuto_party can be set to 2 instead of 1; this will only attack
  monsters that attacked the party, and not monsters that the party hit.
  This fixes the "tank hits monster, bot mage casts spell on monster, monster
  hits bot since it hasn't retaliated against the tank yet" problem.
- New config "attackCheckLOS 1"; when activated, this will enable the new
  experimental LOS check code. If you are a ranged attacker
  (attackDistance > 2), this code will check whether it thinks you have a
  clear line of attack to the target; if not, it will attempt to move to a
  space where you do, while respecting runFromTarget_dist and
  followDistanceMax. This code isn't perfect yet! It will frequently be unable
  to find a solution.
- Config option attackNoGiveup will make bot not stop attacking enemy
  even if it can't damage it. Useful if your attackSkillSlot is e.g.
  Spell Breaker.
- attackCanSnipe (flag)
  Set to 1 if your character can snipe (archers/mages).
- statsAddAuto (flag)
  Automatically increase stats.

  statsAddAuto_list (stats)
  Example:
  statsAuddAuto_list 10 vit, 20 str, 25dex, 30 vit, 30 str, 50 vit, 40 str

  works again now (ai_skillUse() was passing $args{target_x} instead of
  $args{x}).
- Warp Portal opening message now shows correct person name

- Joseph: NPC color code stripping.


==================
### 1.4.10
==================

For those who are confused about the version number:
This is 1.4.10, not 1.4.1.0. The version number didn't go backwards. 10
comes after 9, right?

Bug fixes:
- When an aggressive monster attacks you while walking to lockMap, Kore
  will attack all non-aggressive monsters before it continues to walk to
  lockMap. This has been fixed.
- oRO and euRO language characters (|00) are now supported.
- Some teleport_search flooding bugs are fixed.
- teleportAuto_allPlayers will only teleport when not in lockMap (or
  when lockMap is not set).

New config options:
- chatLangCode (code)
  If your RO server uses language codes in chat messages, you can specify
  that here. euRO and oRO use "|00" (without quotes) as language code.
  If you leave this option empty, the language code will be automatically
  detected whenever Kore sees someone talking. Set to "none" if your
  server does not use language codes, and you don't want it to (falsely)
  autodetect the language code.

Credits:
- doenet: euRO and oRO language character support.
- jsteng: monster type change packet support.


==================
### 1.4.9
==================

Wx interface:
- Improvements to the map viewer:
  * Monsters and players are now also displayed.
  * Drawing is now double buffered. This means no more flickering on Windows.
- There's now a listbox showing the current players on screen.
- You can select between "command mode" and "chat mode". In command mode,
  the text you enter in the input box are recognized as commands. In chat
  mode, the text you enter will become chat messages, just like when you
  enter text in the real RO cient.

New config options:
- teleportAuto_allPlayers (flag)
  If set to 1, teleport when anybody is on screen.


==================
### 1.4.8
==================

New features:
- A new config.txt parser!
  Do you also hate config options like this?
  useSelf_item_0 Apple
  useSelf_item_0_hp < 50
  useSelf_item_0_whenStatusActive Inc AGI
  useSelf_item_1 White Potion
  useSelf_item_1_hp < 10
  useSelf_item_1_whenStatusActive Blessing

  Instead of the above, you can now write this:
  useSelf_item Apple {
      hp < 50
      whenStatusActive Inc AGI
  }
  useSelf_item White Potion {
      hp < 10
      whenStatusActive Blessing
  }

  As you can see, no more messing with numbers, or typing long lines!

Bug fixes:
- Remove the "Inventory:" debug message that I forgot to remove.
- Correctly resize the map viewer in Wx interface.
- Hopefully fixed the autostorage-vs-sitauto bug.


==================
### 1.4.7

  last release, which caused Kore to crash.


==================
### 1.4.5
==================

New features:
- When a monster casts on you, you can switch target and/or avoid its spell.
  You can turn this option on by editing mon_control.txt. The new syntax
  for mon_control.txt is:
  (monster name) (attack) (teleport) (search) (avoid spell)

  Example:
  Minorous 1 0 0 1
  The "1" at the end will make Kore avoid spells casted by Minorous.
- Ability to automatically put items in cart. You can do this by editing
  items_control.txt. The new syntax is:
  (item name) (minimum in inventory) (autostore) (autosell) [put in cart]
  So to put all Flowers in cart:
  Flower 0 0 0 1
- Wx interface's map viewer can now attach to and detach from the main window.

New config options:
- attackMinPortalDistance (number)
  Only auto-attack monsters that are at least (number) blocks away from a
  portal. The default value for (number) is 4.

Bug fixes:
- Hopefully fixed some stuck problems.

- Arrow equip is detected correctly.
- Lag will no longer (incorrectly) trigger autostorage/autobuy/equipauto.
- Fix partyAutoShare.
- Clear AI after autorestart.
- Fix display of guild name in guild join request.

==================
### 1.4.4
==================

New features:
- Ability to take an item as fast as possible (as soon as it appears):
  in pickupitems.txt, set the flag to 2. Example:
  Vitata Card 2
  This will pick up Vitata Card as soon as it appears.
- Auto-drop support: automatically drop an item when it appears in the
  inventory. This is useful for Rogues with auto-steal.
  In pickupitems.txt, set the flag to -1.

Bug fixes:
- The "monster with no name" bug should be a lot less common now, if it
  still exists at all.
- Fixed a bug which caused unjustified "Can't reach target" messages.
- Fixed party auto share.

Credits:
- Joseph: Auto-drop, fast item take
- mfr, Xeno-chan: advanced 2-2 skills support.
- Steven80s: Umbala maps and portals

  autoBuy.


==================
### 1.4.1
==================

New features:
- idRO's new secure login keys are now supported. Set secureLogin_type to 4
  or 5, depending on your server.

New config options:
- secureLogin_requestCode
  If idRO's secure login key changes again, you don't have to modify the
  source code to be able to login. Put the secure login key in this option.
  Example:
  04 02 22 37 D7 FC 8E 9B 05 79 60 AE 02 33 6D 0D 82 C6
  (Do not append "DB 01" at the end of the key; it's automatically 
  appended.)

Bug fixes:
- The shop.txt parser now correctly handles CRLF (DOS) line endings in Linux.
- If you type "stand", then type "sit", Kore will sit and then stand.
  This is fixed.
- Don't attack monsters that are standing on a spot that's unwalkable
  according to the field file. This prevents an infinite loop.
- getAuto never gets triggered if you're low on a certain item. This has
  been fixed.


==================
### 1.4.0

New features:
- "<name> refined weapon <success/failure>" messages from modkore added.

- Fix some memory leaks.
- Various messages no longer spam X-Kore.
- partySkill targetTimeout is now honored.
- 'talk num' command bugs fixed.

New config options:
- teleportAuto_useSP - use SP (cast skill) when using teleport without item

Credits:
- mfr: Updated emoticon list.


==================
### 1.3.5 (beta)
==================

- Fixed a rare bug which caused OpenKore to quit with a "version too old"
  error.


==================
### 1.3.4 (beta)
==================

Hopefully the last beta.

==================
### 1.3.1 (beta)

  alias_e east
  alias_w west
  alias_s south
  alias_ne northeast
  alias_se southeast
  alias_sw southwest
  alias_nw northwest

  # new names for existing commands
  alias_sc s

==================
### 1.3.0 (beta)
==================

** Important notices:
- The format of portals.txt and portalsLOS.txt have been changed. You must
  upgrade to the latest tablepack.

- Tools.cpp has changed. Linux users must recompile Tools.so.

- attackSkillSlot, useSelf_skill and useSelf_item and gotten a major
  revamp. It is recommended that you create recreate your configuration
  from scratch using the default config.txt.

  The biggest change is that _lower/_upper and that kind of things have
  been deprecated in favor of "range operators". For example, this:
    useSelf_skill_0_hp_lower 0
    useSelf_skill_0_hp_upper 50
  becomes:
    useSelf_skill_0_hp <= 50

  However, the old _lower/_upper syntax is still supported.


--------------------------


New features:
- Kore will no longer hug walls. Walking should be smoother now.
- Startup is now *much* faster than before.
  We've gotten rid of the "forking input server".
- Command prompt improvements:
  * Your command prompt will now be kept visible even when output is printed
    to the screen.
  * You can get the command you previously typed by pressing the Up/Down arrow
    key.
  * Keys like the Left arrow, Right arrow, Home and End now work.

- Support for priority attacks. Current only works with aggressive monsters.
  See control/priority.txt for more information about how to use this.
- You can now set your own NPC storage steps.
  See the configuration options storageAuto_npc_type and
  storageAuto_npc_steps
- Support command aliases. For example, you can write in config.txt:
      alias_heal sp 9
  and then if you type "heal 0", it will behave as if you typed
  "sp 9 0", so if spell #9 is Heal it will cast Heal on player #0.
- Even better support for opening warp portals.
  New command: warp list (list warp portal maps)
- Support for sending numbers to NPCs.
  For example, you can now buy Phracons in the Prontera upgrade shop.
  New command: talk num (#number)
- Background colors in consolecolors.txt are now supported.
- Added optional parameter for chist, "chist 10" will show last 10 lines of
  chat.txt.
- Better support for secure logins.
- Support for party skills.
- Added ability to activate skills or use items based on current active
  skills (such as blessed, agi upped, etc). This allows you to re-activate
  skills that have been deactivated without using timeouts.
  This is similar to modkore's _inStatus/_outStatus feature.
- Added ability to activate skills or use items based on current
  status ailments/looks (like poisoned, hidden, etc.)
- Added ability to equip items based on the current situation (hp, sp,
  what skills you're about to use, etc.)
  This allows you to, for example, equip a teleport clip just before you
  use teleport.
- The Linux version now automatically compiles Tools.so for you if it
  doesn't exist.
- The "follow" feature can now follow the master even if he's off
  screen, if the master is in the same party.
- The Linux version now longer needs --daemon.
  So './openkore.pl &' will Just Work(tm).
- You can now specify a location instead of NPC ID for storage/buy/sell.
  Format: map x y
  eg: storageAuto_npc prontera 29 207
  You must also add ai_npcTalk to timeout.txt
- monk's spirit is now supported, format: useSelf_skill_x_spirit < 5

New commands:
- warp list
  List warp portal maps.
- talk num (#number)
  Respond to an NPC with a number.
- plugin
  Control plugins. Type 'plugin help' for full usage description.
- ai clear
  Clears the AI sequence queue.


New configuration options:
- shop_random
  When set to 1, the item order in the shop will be randomized. The behavior
  in the previous releases was to always randomize shop item order, but now
  it's configurable.
- storageAuto_npc_type and storageAuto_npc_steps
  If storageAuto_npc_type is blank it will use the current steps (and
  display a warning)
  			     1 it will use the current steps (c r1 n)
  			     2 it will use the steps for the comodo npcs (c c r1 n)
  			     3 it will use the steps defined in autoStorage_npc_steps
  storageAuto_npc_steps is a (any number of) space(s) seperated list of
  commands to send while attempting to store.
  These commands consist of n which will send the cancel command
  			    c which will send the continue command
  			    r* which will send a responce where the responce number is *
  			    (NOTE responce numbering starts at 0 (unlike it does if you
  			    are using sendTalkResponse)) after training everyone to start
  			    counting at 0, i thaught it best to preserve it ;)
- secureLogin
  secureLogin_type
  secureLogin_account
  These options are used for secure logins.
- partySkill_#_*
  Used for party skills.
  See config.txt in the latest confpack.
- useSelf_skill_#_whenStatusActive
  useSelf_skill_#_whenStatusInactive
  useSelf_item_#_whenStatusActive
  useSelf_item_#_whenStatusInctive

  Activate skill/use item only if your character have a certain status
  ailment/look, like poisoned, hidden, etc. Take a look at
  skillslooks.txt, skillsstate.txt, skillsstatus.txt and skillsailments.txt in the
  latest tablepack for a list of names.
- equipAuto_*
- useSelf_skill_#_notWhileSitting
  If set to 1, this skill will not be used while sitting.
- useSelf_skill_#_notInTown
  If set to 1, this skill will not be used if you're in town.
- route_maxWarpFee
  The maximum amount of money you're willing to spend on a Kapra which
  teleports you to another map.
- autoTalkCont
  If set to 1, kore will automatically type 'talk cont' for you when
  you're in a conversation with an NPC.
- attackAuto_inLockOnly
  When walking to lockmap, only attack monsters if this option is set to 0.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed comma placement in formatNumber sub (its what puts the commas
  in your zenny amount).
- When in X-Kore mode, the RO client will still work if you shutdown
  Kore. However, you can't start Kore in X-Kore mode again until you've
  restarted the RO client.
- Kore will now correctly continue if it gets resurrected before respawn.
- Even if it was resurrected using the Resurrection skill.
- avoid_ignore now works properly.
- Kore now works correctly on eathena servers.
- Damage numbers above 65535 (e.g. from Guillotine Fist) should be
  displayed correctly now, but my monk can't do that much damage; can
  someone test and report on the forum please?
- Fixed bug where openkore would say "Unknown uses" instead of the
  correct name of the player who had cast an area attack spell.
- Carded and forged items should now be displayed correctly everywhere
  (inventory, deal, cart, storage, vending shops). Post your comments in
  http://openkore.sourceforge.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1491
- openkore now supports the use of more area effect spells using ss/sp
  command.
- And lots of other misc bug fixes.


Internal:
- Fully migrated to the logging framework. Thanks to floAt.
- Experimental plugin system.
- Interfaces are closer to completion --interface can now be used on the
  command line to select an interface to use. 'Console' is the default 
  interface. There is only one alternate interface at this point 'Tk' a
  stripped down version of modKore's Vx mode.
- Support packet 01D7 (Karasu).
- New functions itemName() and itemNameSimple() to parse item info.
- teleportAuto_portal bugfix by joseph.

- Ability to open a warp portal. See the "New commands" section about
  'sl' and 'warp'.
- A new experience report feature.
  See the "New commands" section about 'exp'.


Changes:
- Kore is now partially split into multiple modules.
- Some memory leaks have been fixed.
- Loading fields is now 3 times faster (it takes 0.3 seconds on my Athlon
  1.4 Ghz).
- Don't immediately reconnect if connecting to master server times out.
- The "sit" command now also sets itemsGatherAuto to 0.
- Don't drop target when a monster has already attacked you, but switches
  target later. This fixes a lot of "kore walks away when being kill
  stealed" complaints.
- Don't autorestart while taking items.
- Completely revamped cart inventory handling.
- Fixed storage issues.
- Log files (item log, chat log, walk.dat) are now stored in the logs folder.


New commands:
- cart desc - similar to 'i desc' but for the cart.
- Added the commandline argument --daemon. This argument allows you to
  start kore without input server so kore won't read input from console.
  Mostly useful for Linux users who run kore as a background service.
- sl - use skill on location
- warp - open warp portal
- exp - detailed report of gained experience, killed monsters, etc.


New/changed config options:
- useSelf_item_# can now be a comma-seperated list. Example:
  useSelf_item_0 Red Potion, Yellow Potion
- Config options for automatically switching configuration file:
  autoConfChange, autoConfChange_files, autoConfChange_min, autoConfChange_seed

  If autoConfChange is set to 1, switch configuration file after a certain
  amount of time. It's calculated as follows:
  time = autoConfChange_min + random(autoConfChange_seed)

  autoConfChange_files is a comma-seperated list of filenames. A random
  file from that list will be chosen as the new config file to load.

  Think of this feature as a more flexible version of timed lockMaps.
  With this feature you can not only set different lockMaps, but also
  different Kapras.
- sitAuto_over_50: when set to 1, kore won't sit when overweight.
- The config options "partyAutoDeny" and "dealAutoDeny" have been
  replaced by "partyAuto" and "dealAuto".
  0 = disable, 1 = auto-cancel. 2 = auto-accept


Special credit to:
- Digital Anomaly (support for packet 01EE)
- floAt (mon_control.txt's new auto-teleport flag)
- pmak (warp funcins)
- kokal (exp report)

- Fix vending.


==================
### OpenKore 1.0.1
==================

Bugfix release (iRO server changes on March 10 2004)
- Inventory listing fixed.
- Cart listing fixed.
- Linux version now uses XS instead of C::DynaLib.


==================
### OpenKore 1.0.0
==================

NOTE: a lot of new config options has been added. It's highly recommended
take the default configuration files and modify them, so that you won't
miss any of the new config options.

- Forgot to mention in the last News.txt:
  followEmotion requires another config option: followEmotion_distance
  The master must be within this distance to imitate his emoticons.
- Better way to autodetect platform (using $^O).
- Fixed teleportAuto_search.
- Added comments to some pieces of code.
- Fixed a typo in the clientSuspend AI sequence.
- Improved anti-looting.
- Don't get disconnected when AI's turned off in non-XKore mode.
- Changed avoidGM and avoid player code to an AI sequence.
  New entry for timeouts.txt:
	ai_avoidcheck 0.5
  New config options:
	avoidList	(set to 1 to turn on the avoid list)
	avoidList_reconnect
- Removed the need for the local_port config option.
  You can remove this option now!
- Input client child process will now exit correctly if parent process
  exits abnormally.
- Implemented a simple form of dynamic code reloading. All functions
  are now in functions.pl.
  New command: rc (reloads functions.pl)
- Vending code now supports multiple non-stackable items.
  Code by Star-Kung.
- Began work on Win98 support in Tools.dll and Inject.dll. It currently
  doesn't work so don't try it out!
- New config options:
  logChat, logPrivateChat, logPartyChat, logGuildChat, logSystemChat,
  logEmoticons
  Enables/disables logging of certain chats.
  The option logEmoticons is a comma-seperated list of emoticons numbers
  (see tables/emotions.txt), that you want to log.
- New config option: followBot
  Specifies that followTarget is a Kore bot. When enabled, a "move"
  command will be PM'ed to the follow target, telling him to go to
  where you are.
- Don't attack any monsters that are near portals.
- Renamed the following config options for better naming consistency:
  IgnoreAll      -> ignoreAll
  maxDmg         -> teleportAuto_maxDmg
  teleportDeadly -> teleportAuto_deadly
- Merged Karasu's storageAutoGet code and modified it a bit.
  Config options:
  getAuto_0 Red Potion
  getAuto_0_minAmount 10
  getAuto_0_maxAmount 50
  getAuto_0_passive 0

  Kore will go to storage (you need to set storageAuto and storageAuto_npc)
  to get Red Potions when you have 10 or less Red Potions in your inventory.
  It will get as many Red Potions as needed so that your inventory will have
  50 of them.
  If getAuto_0_passive is set to 1, then Kore will not go to storage when
  you have less than 10 Red Potions in your inventory. But, next time it
  goes to storage (because of overweight), it will get the Red Potions.
- New config option: useSelf_skill_0_inLockOnly
  Use a skill only when in lockMap.
- New config option: maxWeight_sellOrStore.
  Kore will sell or go to storage if weight equals or is bigger than
  itemsMaxWeight_sellOrStore. While walking to the sell/storage NPC,
  Kore will pick up loot as long as your weight is under itemsMaxWeight.
- New config options:
  storageAuto_distance
  buyAuto_0_distance
  sellAuto_distance
  Set a distance so Kore won't walk into an NPC.

xlr82xs:
- Removed dead monster count sub.
- Added admin password generation on blank aswell as default (since the skore default
  is blank, not "xxxxxxxxxx"
- New config.txt option securePassword. When turned on (ie set to 1) it will generate
  a new admin password every session
- New feature: random autoRestart:
  * Added new sub initRandomRestart() to randomise autoRestart in the config.txt file
    initRandomRestart() is controled by two new config.txt options autoRestartSeed 
    and autoRestartMin.
    autoRestart is now generated by autoRestartMin + rand(autoRestartSeed)
  * To carry on with the spirit of random restart times, there are another 3 new config.txt
    options.
    autoRestartSleep which turns on sleeping for a random time when set to 1
    autoSleepMin and autoSleepSeed (which act the same as the randomrestart options)
- Began work on better communication between bots. (Being lazy to start with (for a quick implement)
  and simply using a sub to detect known names (ie tank and follow targets, auth list users) that should
  be ignored by things such as chat ai so they can send eachother commands via chat (ie move, heal, etc)
  Eventually I'm looking at having the bots generate diagnostic information on a designated port, that can
  be polled by tankees (so they can find the tanker) and healers, so they can see the other bots location,
  hp, etc
  
- If you have the detoxify skill (by a card or being a thief) and get poisoned, you will automagically use it
- changed configModify() so it accepts a third paramater if it is 1 configModify() operates in "silent mode"
- added ai_itemExchangeCheck() returns 1 if you have atleast the amount of items specified in config.txt
	 you'll REALLY have to check the source for more information on this one (i just spent 10 minutes describing it
	 (i suck at documentation) and i'm about dead now)
  *  added AUTOEXCHANGE {  a new ai section to exchange items at an npc (see above for information about documentation)
	 although, the source is fairly documented...
  *  Made a note to make this more readable tommorrow after i've gotten some sleep.
  *  lots of new config.txt options along the lines of itemExchange_item_0, itemExchange_amount_0 itemExchange_minamount_0
	 and itemExchange_npc aswell as itemExchange_steps
- Shamelessly stole and implemented ebilguy / BCN's autodeal code




ChangeLog for skore-revamped
=============================

Another skore-revamped release (for those who complain about support for
(pre-)comodo):

- Added GPL clause.
- Improved platform autodetection. Won't attempt to execute 'uname -s'
  on Windows anymore.
- New function: lookpos().
- New command: lookp. Face a person.
- Resurrect the followSitAuto config option. Somehow it was in the manual
  but not implemented.
- New option: followFaceDirection. When set to 1, always look at master.
- Faster autofollow.
- "pl" and "ml" show more information now.
- Added support for recvpackets.txt (code taken from ModKore).
- Support secure login. New config option: secure
  0 = no secure login (iRO)
  1 = secure login method 1
  2 = secure login method 2
- New config option: guildAutoDeny
  Automatically deny guild join request.
- New command: guild. Support for listing guild members and info (thanks
  to ModKore).
- The avoidGM option is now split into avoidGM_near and avoidGM_talk.


Based on blueviper22's mod for RO 4.0:

- Merged X-Kore with skore-revamped. You can switch between "normal"
  (console) Kore and X-Kore by setting the config option "XKore"
  to 0 or 1. Add these to your config.txt:
  XKore 1
  exeName ragexe.exe
  commandPrefix ;

(Why didn't Kura do this in the first place? Maintaining one codebase is
easier than maintaining two.)


- More flexible packet debugger.
  * Removed option debug_packet
  * New options:
    debugPacket_unparsed: Dump unparsed packets
    debugPacket_received: Display all received packet switches
    debugPacket_ro_sent:  Display packet switches sent by the
                          RO client (only in X-Kore mode)
    debugPacket_sent:     Display packet switches sent by Kore
    debugPacket_exclude:  All packets switches that you want
                          to ignore, seperated by a comma.

- New config options:
  * followEmotion
  * followEmotion_distance
  When follow and followEmotion are on, imitate the master's
  emoticons if he's within followEmotion_distance blocks distance.

- Servers will now be hammered less if Kore gets disconnected.
  * New option in timeouts.txt: reconnect x
    (x is the number of seconds to wait before relogging in.)

- Improved anti-kill steal routines.
  * Bug fixes.
  * sendAttackStop() now actually works.
  * Doesn't walk away anymore when KS'ed.
  * The stun bug *should* be fixed by now but is untested.

- Code cleanups
  * Added comments to some parts of the code.
  * Indentication fixes (use Tabs, not spaces!).

- Renamed command "ai" to "aiv"
  Shows content of @ai_seq
- Command "ai" now toggles AI on and off.

- Respect itemHistory config option.

- New packets: 40A1, 01B0

- Automatically detect platform. No more need to change buildType if
  you're running Kore in Linux.

- Check valid $$r_args{'session'} before calling $CalcPath_destroy().
  This partially fixes a rare crash on teleport.

- "nl" now also shows NPC ID.

- Do not automatically attack monsters that are within than 4 blocks
  distance of another player. This makes you less suspicious.

- When a player teleports, he won't get removed from the player list.
  This has been fixed.

- Fixed attackAuto_followTarget. Attack the monster even if it misses
  the follow target.
